## Intro

We're now 10 weeks into my last term, so about halfway done! 70 = (3+4)×10 wonderful days of completion to go.

## Faith vs perceived control

>If we have everything, we do not need to exercise our faith. **But if we have only the Lord, we surely need to exercise our faith.** (CWWL, 1993, vol. 2, pg. 341)

![faith vs control graph](../../img/04.28.25.2.webp)

To "exercise faith" is not necessarily to grit your teeth and try really hard to believe that everything is OK. It is to choose to look away from the self and its feelings and look toward God. **The more perceived control we have over our circumstances, the less we rely on God.**

I believe we have all experienced turning to God in desperate times when we had little control over the situation. On the other hand, when we are confident in navigating a certain situation ourselves, we hardly turn to God.

For example: we oftentimes pray for a safe trip for ourselves or others before flying. Why do we do this? Because we have no control over who the pilot is and how well they feel like flying today. **But how often do we pray before driving?** Not very often (at least for me). Because when we drive, we are in control so we do not feel the need to pray, whereas when we fly, our safety is in the pilot’s hands.

Even though **driving is massively more dangerous** than flying (even if you are a perfect driver because we all share the same road), we don’t feel the need to exercise faith when driving because **the steering wheel is in our hands**. God can then operate in two ways: 

<ol style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 1.2em; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 500; color: #333;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Wait for us to willingly let go and allow Jesus to take the wheel</li>
  <li>Take away our steering wheel</li>
</ol>

## (1) Willingly let it go

Praise the Lord if you are willing to let go and hand over what you consider precious to the Lord! For example, in 1933, Brother Lee worked a job to take care of his wife, three children, and the church, but he felt the need to serve full-time. Although he didn't have the faith, he nonetheless exercised faith to let go of his job:

<blockquote style="font-family: Georgia, serif; background: #f9f6f2; border-left: 4px solid #c8b7a6; padding: 1em 1.5em; margin: 1.5em 0; color: #555; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.7;">
Therefore, the Lord now reminded me, “Did you not consecrate yourself? Did you not answer My call?” But I considered that in the church my younger brother and I received the most income and that we gave most of the offerings. I also had a wife and three children. If I gave up my career and still gave offerings to take care of others, who would take care of me? I did not have sufficient faith.
<br><br>
Beginning on August 1, I struggled for three weeks. By August 23 I could not go on, so I fellowshipped with the two leading brothers and asked them to pray for me. I also knelt down before the Lord at night to fellowship with Him. Finally, I decided to resign from my job the next day. (The History and Revelation of the Lord's Recovery, Ch. 2)
</blockquote>

![feedback loop](../../img/04.28.25.3.webp)

By exercising faith, we enter into a kind of positive feedback loop. When we hand ourselves, our possessions, and our circumstances to the Lord, we are forced to exercise more faith since now we can only rely on the Lord. As faith is continually infused into us, we are then strengthened to hand ourselves even more to the Lord. Brother Lee said his faith was not sufficient, but that doesn't matter. **We have a spirit of faith** (2 Cor. 4:13). We don't need to *feel* "faithful" to exercise the faith which is for sure in our spirit.

…but in my experience, God usually has to force the steering wheel out of my hands before I feel like exercising faith.

## (2) Nooo pls give the wheel back :(

Praise the Lord that He sovereignly arranges our circumstances to cause us to have no control over our situation! He reminds us that the great <span style="font-family: 'Merriweather', serif; font-weight: 700; ">I AM</span> is the only constant factor in our lives we can depend on.

It's like a little kick-start to get you into the cycle:

![feedback loop 2](../../img/04.28.25.4.webp)

The more loops we go in this merry-go-round, the more our faith grows. Furthermore, **God's goal in taking away our steering wheel is not that we would pray to get the steering wheel back** (or for a better steering wheel), but that we would learn to turn to God and be infused with Him who is faith itself and be satisfied as long as we have this all-inclusive One in our spirit!

The training is a very good environment for learning to trust in God. Here, there are many things—some small, some big—that we cannot control. Outside the training, you can solve problems however you like, or just chuck them into oblivion and move on. But in the training, you’re boxed in. You don't have the freedom to fix things on your own terms. Sometimes, I know that anything I try would be useless or detrimental to the building up of the Body of Christ, so I can only hand it over to the Lord :)

Earlier this year, I wrote a song to express how difficult it is to rely on God over the old man's self-pursuit (warning loud guitar intro)

<b>[Verse 1]</b><br>
You know my heart, <br>
I really want to rely on You,<br>
I’m sorry that, <br>
I just can’t help my self-pursuit,<br>
Trials may come, <br>
But I can often find my own way,<br>
I know somehow, <br>
You just want me to stop and pray: <br><br>

<i>Lord, come in—<br>
I want to see the shining of Your face.<br>
Take my veils away,<br>
Heal my eyes to see,<br>
You are all I need.</i><br><br>

<b>[Chorus 1]</b><br>
Lord, You know,<br>
I don’t want to live in blindness any longer,<br>
I don’t want my fallen life to be stronger, <br>
I just want You, to love You as the most precious One.<br>
Lord, You know,<br>
I don’t want to be stuck in my situations,<br>
Begging You to give me a bit more patience,<br>
Purify me, to come with no intentions—<br>
Simply to see Your face.<br><br>

<b>[Verse 2]</b><br>
The other day, <br>
I was so sure I was doing fine,<br>
But come today, <br>
All I’ve done is complain and whine,<br>
I want to move, <br>
But all my options lead me astray.<br>
I know somehow,<br>
You just want me to stop and pray:<br><br>

<i>I’m so dumb,<br>
To be distracted by the outward things.<br>
Living deep within,<br>
Christ in me must be,<br>
My reality.</i><br><br>

<b>[Chorus 2]</b><br>
Lord, You know,<br>
I don’t want to know You as dead words of doctrine,<br>
I don’t want to miss Your real living person,<br>
Show me Your smile, I’ll love You as the most precious One.<br>
Lord, You know,<br>
I don’t want my suff’ring to miss Your dispensing,<br>
Fill me with Your joy when all sides are pressing,<br>
I can contact, and gain You in each moment, <br>
You’re always there for me.
