## Intro

We're now 8 weeks into my last term, 12 more weeks to go! This weekend, the brothers serving in Fullerton stayed the night at Riverside.

Anyways, the Wednesday night ministry meeting this week was on the significance of being "in Christ." This phrase appears 70+ times in the New Testament and is what the Greek letters in the LSM logo say.

But what does it really mean to be in Christ? If our impression of being in Christ is vague, then our experience will also be vague. Generally speaking, we experience and enjoy what we know and are aware of. For example, **if we don't know** that Costco sells a $1.50 hot dog and soda combo, then **we cannot reliably experience or enjoy** that aspect of being in Costco. 

## Two Deaths

A picture the Bible gives of being put into Christ is grafting, where a branch from one tree (the scion) is attached to the trunk of another (the rootstock). You were once part of a wild olive tree and grafted into Christ as the cultivated olive tree (Rom. 11:17, 24). This required two deaths:

1. Your death signified by the branch cut from the old tree
2. Christ's death signified by the cut made into the new tree in which to insert the branch

>I am **crucified with Christ**; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me...

*\- Galatians 2:20*

This is what it means to be crucified **with** Christ! Now you no longer live by your own life, but by a mingled life. You as the branch and Christ as the tree become one.

## Family Tree

Speaking of trees, let's take a look at an extremely simplified family tree of the line between **Abraham and Christ**:

![Abraham to Christ](../../img/04.14.25.3.webp)

From the entire human population, God called out Abraham and promised him that he and his seed would inherit a very good land (Israel). Thus, his seed (the Jewish race) later received and dwelled in this land according to God's promise. But "Abraham's seed" actually has two aspects. Check out this verse:

>I will surely bless you and will greatly multiply your seed like the **stars of the heavens** and like the **sand which is on the seashore**…

*\- Genesis 22:17*

The **sand** refers to Abraham's earthly seed of the material realm, that is the Jewish race we talked about before. However, the **stars** refer to Abraham's heavenly seed of the spiritual realm. Did you know that alongside human history, there is a divine history?

## Divine History

>In order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.

*\- Galatians 3:14*

The reality of the promise of the good land (the blessing of Abraham) is the **promise of the Spirit** (Gal. 3:14). Abraham's physical descendants get a nice piece of land. Abraham's spiritual descendants get **a much better deal**: Christ realized as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. By being grafted into this spiritual tree, into Christ as the shoot of David, we become Abraham's seed (Gal. 3:29). Actually, you can even say we become the *real* Jews (Rom. 2:29). We are fully qualified to receive the promise of the Spirit! 

![coinherence](../../img/04.14.25.5.webp)

Furthermore, now that we are in Christ and have received the Spirit, we become a coinherence—a mutual indwelling—of God and man. This is what Jesus was talking about when He said the Spirit will be in us (John 14:17) and that He would be in us and we would be in Him (John 14:20).
