## The Ideal Christian

After Brother Nee was initially saved, this was his concept of an ideal Christian, whom he had tried his utmost to become:

    <p style="margin:0;">‚ÄúI thought a perfect Christian should <strong>smile from morning to night</strong>. If he shed tears, I thought he was not victorious, but a failure. I would even say he was wrong.‚Äù</p>
  </div>

  <div style="background:#eef9ff; border-left:5px solid #6cf; padding:1em; margin:1.5em 0; box-shadow:2px 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);">
    <p style="margin:0;">"I thought a perfect Christian should be <strong>bold, unafraid, and courageous in every situation</strong>. If he was fearful in anything, I would say he did not have faith. I would say he was not perfect because he did not trust in the Lord."</p>
  </div>

    <p style="margin:0;">"I also thought the perfect Christian was <strong>never sad</strong>. If a person was sad, I doubted that he was perfect."</p>
  </div>

## What about Paul?

After reading Second Corinthians however, Brother Nee realized that the top apostle Paul didn't really meet his criteria for an "ideal Christian." Paul despaired of living (1:8) and shed many tears (2:4). He also had fightings without and fears within (7:5). He was also sorrowful (6:10). Apparently he wasn't really a perfectly holy and victorious Christian. Well, God didn't intend for man to be another type of angel. Or to have a race of marble Marys. **We are frail, mortal, humans.** Second Corinthians can be summed up in one sentence: 

<div style="
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 2rem 1rem;
  font-family: 'Georgia', serif;
  text-align: center;
">
  <div style="
    max-width: 700px;
    padding: 2rem;
    background: #ffffff;
    border: 2px solid #e0cba3;
    border-radius: 16px;
    box-shadow: 
      0 2px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06),
      inset 0 0 0.5rem #fceabb,
      0 0 0.5rem #f0d588;

    font-size: 1.5rem;

    line-height: 1.8;
  ">
    "We have a treasure in earthen vessels..."  
    <br/>
    <span style="display: block; font-size: 1rem; color: #9b8259; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
      ‚Äî 2 Corinthians 4:7
    </span>
  </div>
</div>

Within our pitiful earthen vessel is the perfect all-transcending treasure, Jesus Christ Himself. This is why Paul was always having these paradoxical experiences of two incompatible states:

| The earthen vessel ‚òπÔ∏è | The treasure üòÑ |
| --- | --- |
| Pressed on every side | Not constricted (4:8) |
| Persecuted, cast down | Not abandoned, not destroyed (4:9) |
| Dying | Living (4:10, 12, 6:9) |
| Sorrowful | Rejoicing |
| Poor | Enriching many |
| Having nothing | Possessing all things (6:10) |
| Weak | Powerful (12:10) |

This is a special characteristic of Christianity: there is a smile while tears are flowing. You may think a proper Christian will eventually attain a state of never being sorrowful or troubled. But as long as we are on this earth, we will always have an earthen vessel. **This weak earthen vessel is actually the means by which God can be expressed.** 

The weaker we are, the better the treasure looks. It's only when the earthiness, the weakness of our humanity is clear, that God has the way to gain the glory. It is because Paul experienced all the things in the left column, because his bodily presence was weak, and his speech was contemptible (2 Cor. 10:10), that the Lord could shine brightly. 

We should not think that our earthen vessel is a hindrance to God that we need to fix. By relying on our natural strength to correct our weaknesses, we neglect the treasure and reject God's grace. For example, **it is possible in our fleshly striving to be *too* "spiritual."** As a result, our expression becomes that of an angel, or some enlightened Buddhist monk who thinks everything is beneath them rather than a genuine Christian.

## The humanly-weak church

Consider the case in Acts 12 where Peter was imprisoned and the church prayed fervently for him. Because of their prayer, he was miraculously released! You may imagine the prayer meeting that went on was full of faith, full of victory, and with absolute assurance that God's hand will move for Peter. Perhaps they were even singing with praise and exultation to the Lord. After Peter was released, they might say to each other, "Indeed, we are members of the Body joined to Christ as the Head praying in ascension! Of course Peter was rescued." 

Actually‚Äîjust the opposite:

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #8884d8; padding: 1em 1em 0.25em 1em; margin: 1em 0; font-family: 'Georgia', serif; font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.7; color: #333; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 1px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);">

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;"><strong>13 </strong>And when he knocked at the door of the entry, a maiden named Rhoda came to listen.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;"><strong>14 </strong>And when she recognized Peter's voice, <strong>she did not open the gate for joy</strong>, but ran in and reported that Peter was standing before the entry.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;"><strong>15 </strong>But they said to her, <strong>You are crazy!</strong> But she insisted that it was so. And they said, It is his angel.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;"><strong>16 </strong>But Peter continued knocking; and when they had opened the gate, <strong>they saw him and were beside themselves</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 0.95em; font-style: italic; color: #555;">Acts 12:13-16</p>

</div>

What kind of prayer meeting was this? They didn't even believe in the prayers they were praying? This is just our condition. Our faith is simply short. Brother Nee says "God heard the prayers, **but human weakness was in it.** We do not see them doing anything to hide their weaknesses" (CWWN, vol. 56, pg. 454). We have a high priest who can be touched with the feeling of our weaknesses (Heb. 4:15). No amount of human weakness can limit God's power. He is touched, even moved, by our weakness. 

## My takeaway

Don't be afraid to be weak in your fellowship with God and the saints! Cry, mourn, and groan as much as you want, that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us (2 Cor. 4:7). **Natural weakness is always better than natural strength.** When we are at our weakest, God's operation in us is at its strongest.
