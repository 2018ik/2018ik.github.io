## Intro

Hi saints! We are now 4 weeks into my last term, 16 weeks to go. Last night, all the fourth term brothers gathered at a house in Irvine to feed our entire tripartite being.

Food for the body, puzzles for the soul, singing for the spirit

## Term Dinner

Our brother Rick was there to share his burden for us to appreciate God more. His speaking was primarily on these two verses:

>But if anyone loves God, this one is **known** by Him.
\- 1 Corinthians 8:3

>Chosen according to the **foreknowledge** of God the Father…
\- 1 Peter 1:2a

The words for “known” and “foreknowledge” are both derived from the same Greek word γινώσκω (ginóskó, "to know”). From these verses, we see that:

1. God knows those who love Him (1 Cor. 8:3)
2. We were chosen according to God’s knowing (1 Pet. 1:2)

We can assert **God chose us in eternity past because He knew we would love Him.** Out of the millions of peaches in the peach truck, He chose us because He knew we would be sweet to Him. How much should we appreciate Him, the most attractive One in the universe, for choosing us, dead in our offenses and sins, to be His bride!

So on our side, we can choose to respond. A brother and sister prior to their engagement have a certain love toward each other. After one proposes and they are engaged, this love is elevated. Now, their love is elevated by the realization that they will spend their entire lives together, **involving each other in everything they do**.

When we choose to love God in this way, it’s like issuing a positive response to the divine marriage proposal that we have received. Previously, we may have appreciated God mainly for all the things He’s done for us. But now, our appreciation deepens as we recognize **who He is to us** as we involve Him in our dishwashing and stuff idk

## Drawers

At home, I would always get extremely annoyed whenever someone grabbed something from a cabinet or drawer in the kitchen and left it open. Even worse was when someone finished using the oven or microwave and left the door open. Inwardly, I would **judge them according to my own righteous standard**.

One morning in my first term, as we were getting ready to leave for class, one of my housemates said something I thought I would never hear: **“Hey, you left your drawers open.”** At that moment, I felt both exposed and surprised. I immediately remembered all the times I had silently judged others for doing the same thing, yet now, in the rush of getting ready, **I realized I was no different**. The Lord used this small incident to shine on my inward being, exposing my self-righteousness and lack of grace toward others.

An artistic recreation, it's not usually this bad, probably

Moments like these are how the Body measures and adjusts us. Living in the church life and being built together with the saints is a twofold experience:

1.	On the positive side, we receive mutual cherishing, nourishing, and shepherding.
2.	On the negative side, we are **exposed, cut, broken, adjusted, tempered, and molded** so that we can be fitted together.

I once read an article titled *Why I Stopped Going to Church*, where the author argued: “We are already joined to Christ and one with Christ. Why do we still need to go to church every Sunday? That is too legal.” But that's just the excuse they give. The real reason they don’t want to go is because they think they are superior and **don’t want to deal with the annoying churchgoers**.

If all we do is pray, study the Bible, pray over the Bible, and even write deep expositions of the Bible—yet remain locked in our own room 24/7—we will never be exposed by the Body. It’s very easy to agree with yourself. But can you go along with others? Even when they are "wrong" and you are "right?" Without the Body, we will never realize just how disagreeable, divisive, and delusional we are.

Anyway, nowadays **whenever I see an open drawer, instead of getting annoyed, I take it as a reminder**: Lord, make me more tender toward my brothers and sisters. Teach me to bear others in love and not hold onto my own standard!
