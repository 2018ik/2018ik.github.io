## Intro

Hi saints! We are now 2 weeks into the term, 18 weeks to go.

## Gospel Trip

During the winter interim from January 25th to February 9th, I was on a gospel trip to Albuquerque NM, Flagstaff AZ, and Tempe/Phoenix AZ. During this time, we would stay at saints' homes, preach the gospel on college campuses, and blend with the local saints during various meetings, meals, and meet-ups.

### Albuquerque, New Mexico

Albuquerque is home to two campuses: University of New Mexico (UNM) and Central New Mexico Community College (CNM). Many students opt to attend the community college for the lower cost and then transfer to UNM. It was encouraging to see a flourishing campus work there where the vast majority of the students (if not all) did not grow up in the church life. On the day of the Bible study, the room we reserved had three tables, and the full-timers thought that maybe one or two would be filled. But as students continued to arrive, eventually all the tables were filled and we even had to request additional chairs. Furthermore, the students took notes and highlighted portions of the reading, something college-aged me would've never done in a million years.

My big takeaway here was to know the students according to the spirit, rather than in a natural or superficial way. Some students upon first impression were the type of people I probably wouldn't want to be friends with. But this was actually a blessing - since I wasn’t naturally inclined to be friendly with them, I had to exercise my spirit and engage in conversations centered on more meaningful matters, which led to deeper fellowship and more genuine building up. As we continued to get to know them through tabling, Bible studies, and college meetings, I began to see that they were far more burdened for the gospel and studying the truth than I was in college. Honestly I would probably not want to hang out with myself from back in college either.

We got to ride on this thing

### Flagstaff, Arizona

Flagstaff was cold and 7000 feet high, about 2000 feet higher than Albuquerque. The school here is called Northern Arizona University, and there is currently no locality established here. However, there are many local saints who are burdened for the gospel who meet with students at the school on Lord's day. During this time, they would read a ministry portion and share what they've enjoyed. 

In an older couple's house, I saw a schedule on their refrigerator door which outlined the times of all their appointments with students, coordination with the saints, and various prayer times. It even had exactly what they were going to eat for every meal. This is to live a life of exactness and diligence; to have a proper character for the Lord's work. We also went to the Grand Canyon.

Pondering the meaning of life

### Tempe/Phoenix, Arizona

ASU is one of the biggest universities in the U.S. with around 60 thousand students on the Tempe campus and over 140 thousand total across all campuses and online enrollment. On Thursday, some other trainees and I were asked to attend a meeting in Phoenix to eat dinner and share our testimonies with the brothers and sisters there. When I got there, I did not expect it to be a Spanish-speaking blending time where the other trainee brother and I were the only people who did not speak Spanish. 

It was a bit awkward for me at first, but after we prayed for the meal, I enjoyed some sick tamales and various grilled meats and we started the meeting by singing the famous hymn *¡Oh, qué espléndida es la iglesia como el huerto del Señor!* Then we shared our testimonies with Spanish translation, and some others shared their testimonies in Spanish with English translation, and this bilingual blending became one of the highlights of the trip for me. May the Lord continue to bless the growth in Albuquerque, Flagstaff, Tempe, and Phoenix and raise up a lampstand in Flagstaff.

One of the saints we visited lives at the "edge of the world"

## Did Adam Love Eve?

Recently I have been considering Adam’s “sacrifice” for Eve. 1 Timothy 2:14 reveals that Eve was the one who was deceived, not Adam. So Adam likely knew that eating the fruit was against God's will and would result in severe consequences. Yet, he chose to partake of the fruit with Eve anyway (Gen. 3:6). This is likely because he realized Eve had changed - her eyes were opened to know both good and evil, whereas previously she was unable to feel shame (Gen. 2:25). The two were no longer on the same wavelength, humanly speaking. So perhaps out of his great love for Eve, he opted to **sacrifice himself to take the fall with her**.

On the surface, given that Adam is a type of Christ and Eve is a type of the church[^1], this sacrifice may be a picture of how Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her (Eph. 5:25). But this is **not the case**, as Adam's sacrifice was **willful rebellion against God** and resulted in the fall of man. Types of Christ only go as far as the positive aspects of a particular person. For example, King David was a type of Christ[^2] in many ways, but not his failure with Bathsheba. Likewise, Adam's fall here is not fulfilled in a greater sense by Christ (as would be in a type), rather it was **completely negated**: "So then as it was through one offense unto condemnation to all men, so also it was through one righteous act unto justification of life to all men" (Rom. 5:18). Not only were all men reconciled to Christ, but they would be saved **much more** (Rom. 5:10). While sin abounded, grace **superabounded** (Rom. 5:20).

But it seems like Adam truly loved Eve! So how should we describe his sacrifice? 

| --- | Christ's Death | Adam's Fall |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nature | Act of obedience (Phil. 2:8) | Act of disobedience (Rom. 5:19) |
| Intent | To fulfill God's eternal economy (Eph. 5:25-27) | Emotionally-driven for personal gain |
| Outcome | Life, grace, righteousness (Rom. 5:17-21) | Death, sin, condemnation (Rom. 5:17-21) |

Unlike Christ's pure and selfless sacrifice for the church, Adam's sacrifice was rebellious and selfish. **His love was natural**. In short, he disobeyed God and failed to see the far-reaching consequences of his actions in order to satisfy his personal desire. This could be considered “blind love” in a tragic sense: choosing his wife over God’s command, not making any attempt to fellowship with God, and falling into ruin as a result. Consider how we can love others today:

1. A parent who loves their child in a natural way wants to see them succeed academically and financially.
2. A parent who loves their child with the love of Christ wants to see more of His life dispensed into them regardless of what outward situation they end up in. 

The former is actually **not real love**, since it is not from God who is love itself (1 John 4:16). Christ's love is selfless, obedient, and fulfills God's eternal purpose. Our love is selfish and rebellious toward God, seeking to satisfy our own desires. Although Adam may have chosen to eat the fruit out of his love toward Eve, it was a natural love. Adam should have instead remained obedient by not violating God's command, interceded for Eve by having fellowship with God, and **trusted in God** for the outcome. As with Eve, Adam made no attempt to return to God as the Head and trusted in his own decision rather than God's. May the Lord lead us in our self-seeking to turn back to Him and to trust Him over our natural instincts.
