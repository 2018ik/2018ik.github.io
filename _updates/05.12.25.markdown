## Intro

It's been about 12 weeks since the start of this term. So 8 more weeks to go! Some weeks have been dynamic, memorable, and enlightening. But other weeks feel quiet‚Äîlike we're swimming in still water, not waves. But who has despised the day of small things? If this week felt quiet to you, I hope you can sense that it's nonetheless full of meaning.

## How long, Lord?

I believe at some point we have all prayed for God to do something for us and‚Ä¶ apparently nothing happens. We ask again and again: "How long, Lord? Are you hearing my prayers?" But He stays silent. It can feel as though there is no God in this universe. This is also the experience of many psalmists:

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #8884d8; padding: 1em 1em 0.25em 1em; margin: 1em 0; font-family: 'Georgia', serif; font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.7; color: #333; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 1px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);">
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;"><strong>17</strong> O Lord, how long will You look on? / Rescue my soul from their destruction‚Ä¶</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;"><strong>22</strong> You have seen, O Jehovah; do not be silent. / O Lord, do not be far from me.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;"><strong>23</strong> Awake, and stir Yourself for my cause, / For my claim, O my God and my Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 0.95em; font-style: italic; color: #555;">(Psalm 35)</p>
</div>

Sometimes, after we ask the Lord, the situation gets even worse! For example, Jesus was told that Lazarus was sick, but He waited for him to die from his sickness in order to make known His resurrection power (John 11:3-14). So what do we do? Pray for more patience? Or perhaps for Christ to be our patience üòé? **Actually, the problem is not our patience.** The Lord Jesus finally visiting Lazarus was **not a matter of timing, but a matter of Lazarus dying.**

God keeps us in the dungeon not to test our patience but **to terminate our natural man.** It just so happens that termination takes time. In these moments, God may seem unfair, mean, or questionably existent, but His concept is simply higher than ours. We can see a complete picture of this in the deliverance of the children of Israel from Egypt:

## Suffering in Egypt

At the beginning of Exodus, the children of Israel were forced to labor as slaves under Pharaoh. In type, Israel was a corporate person, illustrating our spiritual experience. Just as they cried out to Jehovah to be delivered from the bondage of Egypt, so we cry out to God to be delivered from various things. **Our cries are heard by God, but He will only deliver us according to His ways.** The children of Israel were trapped in Egypt since before Moses was even born (Exo. 1:13-14), so they must have suffered for multiple generations as God remained silent.

Although God could have easily delivered His people by sending a meteor into Pharaoh's palace, God's way is to operate *in* man and *through* man, not just *for* man. Therefore, a transformed person needs to carry out God's intention on His behalf. However, within Israel, there was no such person at the time. Before Moses was fully prepared, God could not move. So while God was outwardly silent, He was performing a hidden work to deal with and prepare Moses.

Remember: Israel is a corporate person. As the Israelites suffered while Moses was dealt with, so are we placed in difficult circumstances for God to deal with some part of our being. Moses had the same problem as us: he was confident in his natural ability. Quite often, our patience runs dry, so we try to remedy our situation apart from God. By the time Moses reached the ripe age of 40, he had attained the highest Egyptian education, so surely he was capable of doing something revolutionary. We all know how that went...

## Terminating Moses

This is why our situations get worse. We still think we can do something. Moses was run out of town and eventually settled down as a shepherd caring for his flock in the middle of nowhere for forty years.

>When by God‚Äôs sovereignty Moses was set aside, he must have been very disappointed and he must have lost all hope. [‚Ä¶] Moses might have said to himself, ‚ÄúI must care for this flock. But not even this flock is mine; it belongs to my father-in-law. I have no empire, no kingdom. There is nothing left for me to do except to labor in support of my family. My immediate concern is to find fresh grass for the flock and water for them to drink.‚Äù (LS of Exodus, ch. 5, pg. 51)

*Moses' hypothetical conversation with his sheep (LS of Exodus, ch. 62, pg. 734)*

As the years went by, Moses lost everything: his education, his future, his ambitions. Only when he was 80 years old and shepherded sheep for 40 years was God able to move through him to call His people out of Egypt. God did not appear to Moses after an arbitrary length of time, but after he was fully dealt with (signified by 40 years‚Äîthe number for trial) and thought of himself as good for nothing but death. The question is not "when is God going to do something" but "when am *I* willing to be terminated." **God's grace and power are toward those who are weak** (Matt. 9:12; 2 Cor. 12:9).

## We're the problem

Our real problem is not the outward things of our environment, but ourselves. When we pray, God does not give us wisdom or power to overcome our environment. It does not please God to see us succeed by our natural strength. Therefore, He gives us the crucified Christ (see: above griddle pan) to terminate us. Such a concept was a stumbling block to the religious Jews and foolishness to the philosophical Gentiles, but it is God's concept (1 Cor. 1:23-24). 

Are we stumbled by God's inaction? Even John the Baptist was stumbled, not understanding why God was keeping Him in prison (Matt. 11:2-6). Do we think God's ways are foolish? Peter thought it was foolish for the Lord to willingly die and repeatedly tried to save Him (Matt. 16:22; 26:51). God's way, contrary to our own desire, is not merely to solve our problems to make us happy and content. He wants to terminate us from within, which takes true wisdom and power. 

Not every week is a Passover or Red Sea moment. But as the days go by, and our situations remain the same, the Lord is surely silently working. He is arranging all things according to His good pleasure, to show us we cannot make it by ourselves, but by taking His life, we can make it.

>During the past few months, Satan has come to me and has spoken to me many times. He never gives up. He always asks, ‚ÄúHave you overcome? I see that you are still the same.‚Äù I answer him by saying, ‚ÄúIf it were up to me, I would worry. But the Lord is my victory.‚Äù The devil tells me that I am no good in this and that matter, but I only say, ‚ÄúThank and praise the Lord, I am no good.‚Äù He tells me that I am weak, but I only say, ‚ÄúThat is wonderful, now Christ has the opportunity to manifest His power.‚Äù Here we see the preciousness of being weak. What a joy it is to be weak! We are not afraid, and our hearts are filled with thanksgiving and praises because we realize that we are not able in ourselves. (The Overcoming Life, ch. 4, pg. 72)

*Dwaeji gukbap (literally meaning "pork, soup rice") is a Korean dish originally cooked up by poor people in Busan back in the day who would boil leftover pork bones into a creamy, white broth to eat with rice. Rich in calcium, B vitamins, collagen, and probiotics from various fermented side dishes, dwaeji gukbap is an alright-tasting and nutrient-dense meal.*
