Hi everyone, I have nothing interesting to report, so here are some random notes from class:

1. It’s pretty clear that as Christians, we shouldn’t do evil. So we try to do good! However, the main problem isn’t that we fail, or that we end up doing evil anyway, but that we try to achieve goodness **by ourselves**. The Lord wants to do good (or bad[^1]) **with us** in a divine romance. When you love someone, it doesn’t matter whether you go ice skating, fishing, or bowling; what matters is that the activity is done with the one you love. Because God loves us, He wants to do everything with us, and when we love God, we want to do everything with Him. Furthermore, when we love someone, we wouldn’t want to bring them to specific activities (e.g. going dumpster-diving for dinner) because we know who they are and what satisfies them. Likewise, when we love and appreciate God, our service toward Him is spontaneous.
2. We lack the consciousness of needing God and the members of the Body because we are confident in ourselves, that is, confident in our soul[^2]. This is reasonable, as the soul in a sense is **more powerful** than the spirit. For example, a group of full-time campus workers can discuss a problem with their mind, agree on the solution with their emotion, and execute it successfully with their will. This is to be one in **soul** without being one in spirit. Phil. 1:27 tells us to be in one spirit, with one soul. It is **because we are in spirit that we are one in soul**. We should not be one with each other because we agree with each other in an organizational way. Rather, we are one with each other because we are all in one Spirit. The source of genuine oneness is God Himself.
3. Consecration is to consent to God's working in us, using us, and directing our ways. It seems like consecration is a pretty terrible deal since we lose our freedom and are no longer our own (1 Cor. 6:19). But the motive of consecration is to be touched by God’s love. As lovers of God, we voluntarily put ourselves under Him and even enjoy this new limited position. We can likewise ask - why would anyone ever want to get married? You objectively lose your freedom, and life gets more complicated. Some people get married because it’s a good deal, but such marriages usually don’t end well. Eventually, one party finds a better deal and leaves. A marriage/consecration that lasts is one that is motivated by love. We also find out that the "freedom"[^3] we originally had wasn't real to begin with.

[^1]: The Lord Jesus violated certain ordinances and was perceived as lawless by the Pharisees (John 5:8-10; Luke 13:14-16; Matthew 12:1-8). What we think is "good" or "bad" is not necessarily so according to the divine concept.
[^2]: To be confident in the soul is to be confident in ourselves. Denying the self (Matthew 16:24) is the same as denying the soul/psychē (Matthew 16:25).
[^3]: True freedom is in Christ (Gal. 5:12; Cor. 3:17). It seems like worldly people are free to do whatever they want compared to Christians who are restricted in what they can do. But it doesn't matter what we are doing; what matters is whether or not we are in Christ. Whether someone is a billionaire in the Bahamas or an ex-billionaire in prison, they have no freedom unless they are in Christ.
