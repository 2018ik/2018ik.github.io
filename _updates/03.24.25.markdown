## Intro

Hello dear brothers and sisters. We are now 5 weeks into this last term, 15 weeks to go! Recently we covered **Ephesians 2** in a Wednesday night ministry meeting ([this outline](https://www.lsmwebcast.com/archives/S25FTT03en.pdf)). In the first 10 verses, there is a story that reminds me of **Cinderella**: we were miserable but we have been saved by Jesus our King. But how accurately does Cinderella portray our relationship with God? And how come we are still so miserable?

## Who is Cinderella?

A [**Cinderella story**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella) is about a young girl living in forsaken circumstances who is suddenly blessed by remarkable fortune, with her ascension to the throne via marriage. Ephesians chapter 2 says we were dead in offenses and sins (v. 1), but by God’s great mercy, He has raised us up together with Christ to be seated in the heavenlies (vv. 4–6).

Like Cinderella, we were once in the worst circumstance: dead in our offenses and sins. Then we were suddenly blessed by God’s remarkable grace and have even ascended to His throne. We didn’t have to do anything! Everything has already been accomplished by God!

## Objective vs Subjective

So in an **objective** sense, our relationship with God is *technically* a Cinderella story. God deals with man by grace, meaning everything has been done by God and we don’t need to do anything. But there is a principle in the Bible of **fact, faith, and experience**. As far as the fact goes, we are already as perfect as the Lord Jesus. But as far as experience goes, we may not be this way (CWWN, vol. 1, ch. 4).

![facts becoming real](../img/03.24.25.1.webp) 
*God Himself and all He has obtained is fully mingled with our spirit (1 Cor. 6:17) and needs to be made real in our soul (mind, emotion, and will) through faith.*

We need to have a balanced view of the objective facts on God's side and subjective experience on our side. For example, **Calvinists** may emphasize the objective aspect of God’s work—what Christ has already accomplished—but neglect the believer’s active participation in turning to Him moment by moment to carry out His plan. We need to see both sides:

1. Yes, through our union with the Lord Jesus, all of the Lord’s accomplishments and victories are ours.  
2. Now, through faith, the Holy Spirit works to apply in our lives all that the Lord Jesus has accomplished for us to have the practical experience.

## Courting God

On the side of experience, the Christian life is definitely **not** a Cinderella story. The Song of Songs is an allegory of the divine romance between God and man. It is not about the lover’s suffering followed by an overnight salvation. Rather, it depicts the her passing through **transformation** (S.S. 1:9; 2:1), the cross (2:14–15), and many dealings (S.S. 5:2–8) to **become one with Christ** and co-work with Him (S.S. 7:10–12; 8:5).

*Our experience of the Christian life looks more like this.*

Cinderella experienced an instant change in outward status; we are *gradually* transformed in our life and nature inwardly. This period of transformation in the present age is our *courtship* with God. **Cinderella didn't really court** the prince prior to marriage. **Today, we can court God!**

In fact, God is not going to come back to marry His church *unless* we court Him today. (His counterpart has to **match Him**—Eph. 5:25–27.) In an earthly relationship, a couple gets to know each other and becomes more similar over time. In the divine romance, we **get to know God**, and as we behold Him, He infuses us with His element and metabolically transforms us to match Him (2 Cor. 3:18).

## Marriage

The entire Scripture **consummates in the Lord returning to marry the built-up church as the New Jerusalem** (Rev. 21:2). The Lord really wants to finish this age, but after 2,000 years, **it seems like His people are just not getting it!**

Suppose a brother and a sister get engaged, but they decide to postpone marriage until after the sister finishes her last year of college. So he anxiously waits a year for her to graduate in what might be the longest year of his life.

...But two years pass and she’s still in school! She signed up for a bunch of random classes that had nothing to do with her major. Another year passes, then another, and eventually it becomes clear she doesn’t really care about graduating—and by extension, getting married. Surely the brother would be rather frustrated by now.

But **this is a picture of how God feels regarding His church**, who is stuck in “transformation college” and seemingly doesn’t care about preparing herself for marriage. Many Christians simply go about their lives and believe that, like Cinderella, they can just look forward to a future where their Prince will come and fix everything. But that view is too shallow, if not outright wrong. We can—and must—love, enjoy, and court God **right now**!
