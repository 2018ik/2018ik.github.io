## Intro

Hi saints! We are now 3 weeks into the term, 17 weeks to go. I’m definitely not looking forward to the end of my fourth and final term. I love the training 🙃

There's a reason why we all thought this photo was funny but I can't tell you what it is

## First Term

### Faking It

I had no idea what I was doing my first term. I'm actually very good at making it appear like I know what I'm doing when, in reality, I have no idea what I'm doing. This usually involves:

1. Looking like I'm deep in thought while not saying much
2. Waiting for the others to ask all the questions
3. Saying "very good" or "interesting" every so often

But the training is not the best place to “fake it till you make it”—if that were the case, why would I be attending in the first place? I asked myself this question many times. While I knew the exact series of events that caused me to go to the training, I didn't actually know what I expected to get out of it. At this point, the training was just a way for me to escape from the world and set my mind on something else. So that's basically what I did. I dug into the truth, read random ministry books in my free time, and tried to systematize everything I learned into a wiki you can find at [https://psrp.life/wiki/](https://psrp.life/wiki). 

### Praying

In my first term, I found it very difficult to pray, especially in the training classes where there were a bunch of people. I would immediately fall back to the mindset of "well, someone else is going to pray anyways what's the point of me praying?" and not pray. Furthermore, even when I did pray, I always exercised my mind to think and prepare what I was going to pray beforehand in order to make sense of it. This was because I rarely practiced real prayer. In my personal prayer times, I prayed to God in the way of a conversation, which sounds pretty good. I would consider what I wanted to ask for, and then pray it to God. But this is not real prayer.

>If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you.

\- John 15:7

Based on this verse, we first abide in God, that is to turn to Him. Then His words will abide in us, that is He speaks to us. And then we ask whatever we will, which at this point are the words of God, and it shall be done. On one hand, we are praying. On the other hand, He is praying in us. This kind of mutual prayer carried out in the [divine incorporation of God and man](../../wiki/incorporation) is real prayer. Fortunately, God has sovereignly arranged my outward environment since then to force me to regularly open to Him and repent in dust and ashes.

### Team

This is the only photo I have of myself from my first term

On the Fullerton campus team, we went out to preach the gospel on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. My primary objective at the time was to destroy everyone with facts and logic, so I was talking to ChatGPT every day about the arguments other religious groups use and the best counter-arguments for them. But the central focus of any gospel excursion is actually just the Spirit, the Word, and prayer (Acts 6:3-4). Anything more than that is just gimmicks. 

We cannot say that because we've been preaching the gospel for 20 years that we don't need these three things anymore. That would be like an electric fan thinking that because it has been spinning for a while, it doesn't need to be plugged in anymore. By the Lord's mercy though, we met two of our most consistent gospel contacts in my first term, and we still meet with them today.

Don't be like this fan

### Squirrels

In my first term, I found out that there are a lot of squirrels in Anaheim, and they eat everything. I think I have a dozen or so videos of squirrels eating various things.

## God's Goal Is Not To Make Us Happy

[God's goal](../../wiki/gods_economy) is to dispense Himself into us to make us the same as He is in life and nature, to build up the Body of Christ and consummate the New Jerusalem. We may have heard this a million times, but do we genuinely believe that God's goal is more important than our own? In other words, God has a need, and **God needs His need more than we need our need**. Of course, as fallen human beings, we need many things:

1. I keep getting angry, God, please give me more patience.
2. I'm sad, pls make me happy.
3. I'm tired, energize me, please.
4. I have no money, pls help me make my rent payment.

As tripartite beings created with an eternal sense of purpose in our hearts (Eccl. 3:11), we also need to enjoy God as:

1. Full satisfaction
2. Perfect peace
3. Everlasting love

But even this is short of God's goal. Many take God as a divine and mystical enchantment they can apply to live a full and meaningful life. If we only care about satisfying ourselves, even if it is with spiritual things like love, peace, and joy, then **when the test comes, we will fail**. Those who seek their own need will lose faith in God's sovereignty during suffering situations.

Consider Psalm 105:19—God's word tested Joseph. God spoke to Joseph with a dream of his family bowing down to him. But this vision wasn't fulfilled quickly. In fact, the polar opposite seemed to be happening. He was sold by his brothers into Egypt (Gen. 37:27-28), mistreated by some dude and his wife (Gen. 39:7-19), and then sent to prison (Gen. 39:20). But in the midst of these afflictions, he never murmured or complained. That is because he lived toward the vision he saw and **trusted God's promise**. When we are mistreated, do we complain and murmur? Do we accuse God of being unfair? Or do we trust God's promise? 

God has **not promised a happy, smooth-sailing life with no troubles** ([Hymns #720](https://www.hymnal.net/en/hymn/h/720)). According to the Bible, God *has* promised to dispense Himself into us (Eph. 1) and work out all things (Rom. 8:28) to transform us, conform us, and glorify us (Rom. 8:29-30). Do you truly believe that God is working out His economy in you at all times? Is this a vision to you?

If so, you should never complain. Because the righteous and omnipotent God is working according to His infinite power and wisdom to operate in YOUR environment to make YOU the **SAME AS HE IS** in LIFE AND NATURE! If a kid were destined to become a billionaire thanks to his father’s trust fund, he wouldn’t be disappointed or complain if he loses a few dollars. It's illogical! We have GOD HIMSELF **DISPENSED** INTO US EVERY DAY! Why do we care about various aspects of our material world falling apart? The reason is: we are lacking in faith and vision. We need to see God is truly dispensing to carry out His economy in every situation.
