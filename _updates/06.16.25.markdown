## Intro

We just finished week 17 of the training, 2 more weeks until graduation! I rejoice in knowing that God (as God) is utterly unconcerned[^1] about the interests of my natural self and faithfully works out His will in every situation.

## Vision at Jericho

![Joshua](../../img/06.16.25.2.webp)

When he was near Jericho, Joshua saw a vision of Christ as the Captain of Jehovah's army (Josh. 5:13). He sensibly inquired: "Are You for us or for our adversaries?" Well, one might assume Christ would obviously be for Joshua and the Israelites, right? Actually, **He was for neither**. He came as the Captain of Jehovah's army to carry out God's will.

In response, Joshua fell on his face to the ground and worshipped (Josh. 5:14). He could have talked back: "What do you mean you are for neither? Are you not supposed to be for us?" But he did not question God's ways at all. This is real worship: to give glory to God in complete submission. After all, **God is God, and God is always right**. 

God's ways **are not for our interests**, but His. Outwardly, it may seem like God is sometimes "for us" and sometimes "against us" but really, He is just carrying out His economy. And whether God's ways cause us to prosper or suffer, we must nonetheless submit to Him in worship. 

## "For us"

Sometimes God does great things for us! For example, Abraham sent his servant Eliezer to go on a journey to find a wife for his son Isaac. On the surface, this seemed like a crazy request because to get to Abraham's home country of Mesopotamia, you would need to cross the Jordan River, the Euphrates River, and a stretch of desert lying between them. Then he was supposed to somehow convince a random young woman to accept a marriage offer.

Well, we all know how the story went. Eliezer prayed that everything would work out, and everything worked out perfectly. Immediately after confirming Rebekah's family lineage, **he bowed his head and worshipped the Lord** (Gen. 24:23-27). His reaction was not "Wow, what good luck I have!" Or "Cool, I have accomplished my task." Or "Is she going to think this is kind of weird?" But he immediately bowed and worshipped God.

Eliezer had no confidence in himself and gave all the glory to God. We might think our success is due to our capability or luck, but it is actually God. **Proud people cannot worship God for this reason**. They attribute their success to themselves. Everything that we have ever received is God's and should be attributed to God.

## "For our adversaries"

More often, **it seems like God isn't for us at all**. This is because the desires of our natural self tend to be contrary to His ways. We can desperately pray to God just like Hannah but receive nothing in return. It is very hard to worship God when things do not go our way. Instead, we may complain to God, cry to Him, and tell Him to change His ways. Perhaps you can call this prayer or fellowship, but it is not worship. 

David had a very traumatic (though deserved) experience of unanswered prayer. God struck the first son he had with his illegal wife Bathsheba with sickness and basically cursed the child to die. So as any loving father would do, he besought God and even fasted and spent all night lying on the ground. **But after 24/7 fasting and prayer, the child dies** (2 Sam. 12:14-18). 

![David](../../img/06.16.25.6.webp)

David’s servants were afraid to tell him the child had died, fearing that, given his relentless pleading with God, he might be emotionally destroyed to the point of harming himself. But what did he actually do when he found out the child died?

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #8884d8; padding: 1em 1em; margin: 1em 0; font-family: 'Georgia', serif; font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.7; color: #333; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 1px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);">
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;"><strong>20</strong> Then David rose up from the ground and washed and anointed himself and changed his clothes. <strong>And he went to the house of Jehovah and worshipped</strong>. Then he went to his house; and when he requested it, they set food before him, and he ate.</p>
<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 0.95em; font-style: italic; color: #555;">— 2 Samuel 12:20</p>
</div>

That's right—he worshipped God, and then ate food. Can you believe this? Even after a week of unanswered fasting and prayer that ended with his child's death, **David did not rebel, complain, or murmur but rather worshipped God**. This is not to say he was an emotionless robot, but rather that **he knew God was right**. 

## God is God

Brother Nee says, "If my suffering vindicates Your holiness, then I say, ‘Amen.’ If You can make known Your righteousness by my tribulations, then I acknowledge that You do all things well. If Your nature can be vindicated in this way, I gladly accept the sufferings You give me.” This is the way to worship God. (CWWN, vol. 56, pg. 414-415).

We need to know God not only as our Father, but as God. As the Father, He takes care of us in an all-inclusive way. When we come to Him with complaints, He comforts us. When we tell Him how wrong He is in everything He does, He smiles and patiently waits for us to grow up. However, as God, **God is always right**. If we truly know God as God, then we should have the full assurance in His absolute faithfulness and rightness, and submit to Him in everything. Complaining to God means we think God is wrong, which shows we don't really know God as God because God cannot be wrong.

>I do not know what God’s ways are with us. It does not matter whether or not God provides a reason for our suffering; God is always good. God had a reason in David’s case; it was his sin. We are able to explain this suffering. **However, often there is no reason, no sin.** We are not worse than other Christians; we may even be somewhat better than others. So then why do we meet with these difficulties? We should only praise God from the bottom of our hearts and submit to His ways. We must say: 

<div class="glass-loop">
    <p> “God, what You have done is best. I bow before You in worship because what You have done is best.” </p>
    <p style="text-align: right; font-size: 0.8em; font-style: italic; color: #555;">(CWWN, vol. 56, pg. 417). </p>
</div>

[^1]: The truth is twofold, on the one hand, God—as our Father and our Shepherd—cares about and shepherds us to the uttermost (Matt. 6:30-33; Luke 15:20; Psa. 23). On the other hand, God as the one on the throne will carry out His righteous administration regardless of our cries, pleas, and grievances.
