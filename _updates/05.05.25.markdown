## Intro

We are now 11 weeks into the 20-week term! I think by now most of us fourth termers may be ~~thinking really, really hard~~ desperately praying about what our post-training path will look like.

Anyway, there are many lines which run throughout the Bible, over multiple authors and thousands of years, which have a consistency seemingly impossible apart from divine inspiration. This past week in our Wednesday evening class, we discussed the ascension of the Ark to Mount Zion:

## Originally prophesied by Moses

Around 1500 B.C., the children of Israel set out from the wilderness of Sinai to the Ark's resting place on Mount Zion (Num 10:33). During this time, Moses said:

>Rise up, O Jehovah, and let Your enemies be scattered; / And let those who hate You flee before You.
\- Numbers 10:35

The Ark was a storage chest made of acacia wood and overlaid with gold (Exo. 25:10-11), typifying Christ[^1]. Mount Zion typifies the heavenly dwelling place of God, understood to be the third heaven (1 Kings 8:30). We can already see a picture of Christ ascending to the heavens after defeating His enemies.

## Fulfilled in type in David's era

Around 500 years later, the Ark was brought to Zion by David. He celebrates this occasion in Psalm 68 by quoting Moses from before:

>Let God arise; let His enemies be scattered; / And let those who hate Him flee before Him.
\- Psalm 68:1

He then continues:

>You have ascended on high; You have led captive those taken captive; / You have received gifts among men…
\- Psalm 68:18

What does this mean? Who are these captives and what are these gifts? Well back in the day, in the ancient Near East, there were four steps to a successful conquest:

1. The king defeats the enemy, often capturing prisoners (enemy soldiers, kings, nobles, etc.)
2. The captives are led in a procession/parade where they are publicly shamed, often in chains, back to the city
3. The king sits back on his throne and enjoys the view
4. The captives and subjugated nations bring gifts/tributes to distribute to the victors

A successful conquest took place in the good land of Canaan where: 
1. The Ark led the people into Canaan, miraculously destroyed Jericho, scattered the Philistines, etc. (Josh. 5:1; 6:8-20; 1 Sam. 5:11)
2. Those left alive were taken captive and carried away in a procession (2 Sam. 5:21; 8:2)
3. The Ark arrived at Zion as its resting place (2 Sam. 6:12)
4. The spoils were given as gifts/tributes to the Israelites (Deut. 3:7; Josh. 11:14; 2 Sam. 5:7)

## Fulfilled in reality by Christ

Then, another 1000-some years later, the psalm is quoted by Paul one last time in Ephesians:

>Therefore the Scripture says, “Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men.
\- Ephesians 4:8

This passage in Ephesians shows us the reality of the items in the conquest in the Old Testament:

| Item | Reality |
| --- | --- |
| Ark | Christ |
| Enemies | Us (plus Satan and co.) |
| Those taken captive | We were taken captive by Satan |
| Captives | We are now captured by God |
| Ascension to Zion | Christ's ascension to the third heaven |
| Gifts/tributes | Some after being captured by God are given as gifts to the Body|

We were once enemies of God and slaves of sin. In such a condition, we were useless to God but pretty useful to Satan. But in His death and resurrection, Christ defeated Satan and captured us from his domain, leading us as a "train of vanquished foes" in His ascension and gave some as gifts to the Body. To be clear, there are a few different usages of "gift" in the Bible:

| Gift | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Gifted persons (Eph. 4:11) | Apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers themselves *are* gifts given to the Body. These persons are given a special portion by Christ to carry out these functions in a capacity that perfects others to do what they do. |
| Spiritual ability (Rom. 12:6) | God's grace comes with certain spiritual abilities that, as we grow in life, develop into functions through which we can serve God and build up the Body. **In this sense, we are all gifted members.** |
| Miraculous, outward gifts (1 Cor. 12:9-10) | Such as healing and speaking in tongues |
| Other inward gifts | Such as the gift of eternal life (Rom. 6:23), the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38), etc. |

## Today

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;"><strong>11</strong> And He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;"><strong>12</strong> For the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the <strong>building up of the Body of Christ</strong>,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;"><strong>13</strong> Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, <strong>at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ</strong>,</p>
<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 0.95em; font-style: italic; color: #555;">— Ephesians 4:11-13</p>
</div>

The fulfillment in Ephesians 4 doesn't just end with God giving gifts to the Body. It continues to prophesy regarding a **full-grown Body with the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ** (Eph. 4:13). The way we all arrive at this is by each one of us functioning according to our measure (Eph. 4:16). **Do you believe that you are an indispensable gift to the Body?** Ephesians 4:7 says "But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ," meaning each one of us has a certain gift (see the second definition above).

Furthermore, **the gifted persons mentioned in verse 11 are not magical people who uniquely build up the Body.** In fact, they do not build up the Body by exercising their gifts in a vacuum. They build the Body by perfecting the saints, that is by dispensing more Christ into the believers—the Body grows with the growth of God (Eph. 4:12; Col. 2:19). As we all grow in life, our function becomes manifest and we are able to do the same things that the gifted ones do.

## In conclusion...

Here in the training, we are perfected to function as apostles by writing email epistles to our sending localities, as prophets by prophesying once a week in class, as evangelists in our mandatory gospel preaching times, and as shepherd-teachers in our appointments with new ones. However the way we are these things is **not by perfecting a capacity to mimic an outward expression** that is not representative of our inner being, but to **grow under the divine dispensing of God's grace**. We grow by holding to the truth in love (Eph. 4:15), which is just to embrace our dear Lord Jesus and look into His loving eyes in everything that we do.
