## Intro

We're now about 9 weeks into my last term, 11 more weeks to go! This weekend was the Southern California college conference, where we got a whirlwind tour of Ephesians: God’s purpose is to gain the church (Eph. 1:22), the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:23), which requires us to grow in life and be perfected into one (Eph. 4:13–15), so that the Body may be built up in love (Eph. 4:12, 16). 

This was a pretty sick[^1] conference, but my highlight of the week was reading the **Life-Study of Exodus messages 53 to 55**. These are probably the best Life-Study messages I've ever read. I am very surprised that an elderly 74-year-old man can interpret the Mosaic law this romantically.

## Book of love

Most people know the Bible is a book about love. Some may think it's just a **reverential love** where man worships God. Or the **providential love** of the Creator to His creation, like how Steve Jobs might love and care for his iPhone.

Upon actually reading the Bible, some may realize it's a **fatherly love** between God and His children, or a **brotherly love** between the Firstborn Son and His many brothers. At the end of the Bible, they discover that it must be a **romantic love**, since God is marrying His bride, the New Jerusalem. Digging further, we see that the entire New Testament is a betrothing ministry where God courts His chosen people (2 Cor. 11:2).

## Divine romance in the OT

Even the Old Testament explicitly says that God desires a wife:

>Not like the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day I took them by their hand to bring them out from the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke, although **I was their Husband**, declares Jehovah.

*\- Jeremiah 31:32*

Notice God took the children of Israel out of Egypt **by the hand**. The description here does **not** emphasize the power or wisdom of how God freed His people, but rather His gentleness and love in leading them out as their Husband. Furthermore, the covenant, the law, given to the children of Israel was an engagement contract. 

## Engagement contract

The Ten Commandments set the conditions for God’s engagement with Israel. Just a few examples: 

| Commandment | Interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| "You shall have no other gods before Me." (Exo. 20:3) | The Lord should be our unique Beloved. Any man who betroths a woman to himself should require that she not love any man besides him. |
| "You shall not make for yourself an idol..." (Exo. 20:4) | *Idol* can also be translated *graven image*. "God did not want His people to make an image of anything. In like manner, when a young man becomes engaged to a young lady, he does not want her to have photographs of any other men. He wants her to have pictures only of him. Otherwise, he will be offended." (LS of Exodus, Message 53 pg. 623) |
| Read message 53 | For the rest of the commandments |

The conditions of an engagement contract are **very easy to fulfill if one truly loves their spouse**. Why love anyone else? Why have photos of anyone else? This is why the Lord says that **those who love Him** will keep His commandments (John 14:21, 23). Trying to follow the law without love is like signing an engagement contract with someone you don't love and having a hard time. 

## Blind love

What I found most striking in these three messages is that God seems to love us blindly: 

>Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says Jehovah: / I remember concerning you the kindness of your youth, / The love of your bridal days, / When you followed after Me in the wilderness, / In a land that was not sown.

*\- Jeremiah 2:2*

Here, the Lord remembers "the kindness of Israel’s youth and the love of her bridal days," referring to the children of Israel when they wandered in the wilderness. But...

>**I have wondered how much Israel actually loved God in this way.** Perhaps in this verse the Lord was comforting Himself as does a young man who tries to encourage himself when the one he loves fails to respond to his wooing. Such a young man might be encouraged if the one he loves even looks at him. (LS of Exodus, Message 55 pg. 646)

Up to chapter 20 when God gives the law to Moses, there is virtually zero love from Israel toward God. Perhaps Israel encouraged God by "looking at Him" a few times with the songs of Moses and Miriam in chapter 15, but for the most part, they complained their way to Mount Sinai, and murmured their way to the good land. Yet, Jeremiah 2:2 says God somehow remembers Israel's non-existent kindness and love. In a very real sense, God was blinded by His love for His people.

>There **seems to be no reason for God’s love for His people**; He just loved them, almost as if He were blinded by love. He continued to love His people even when they were not faithful to Him. Love blinds people. **The best love is this kind of blind love.** (LS of Exodus, Message 53 pg. 627-628)

*Dinner with a newly-wed couple in Fullerton. May the Lord cause them to close their eyes and love each other blindly.*

The way husbands should love their wives and vice versa is with a blind love. The brothers and sisters should not care for each other's faults but rather see the Christ in one another. Our love for God should even blind us from seeing anything else. Kind of like [the chorus of this hymn](https://www.hymnal.net/en/hymn/h/645):

<blockquote style="background: #fefcf6; border-left: 6px solid #d4af37; padding: 1.2em 1.5em; font-style: italic; font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.7; border-radius: 10px; position: relative; color: #333; box-shadow: 2px 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);">
  <div style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">🎵</div>
  Turn your eyes upon Jesus <br>
  Look full in His wonderful face, <br>
  And the things of earth will grow strangely dim, <br>
  In the light of His glory and grace. <br>
  <div style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-top: 0.5em;">🎵</div>
</blockquote>

My love for God is still very short, but according to the Bible, I am being made love as God is love (1 John 4:8; 2 Pet. 1:4; 2 Cor. 3:18) so amen someday before eternity I will attain to this
