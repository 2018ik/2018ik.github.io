## Intro

We are 15/20 weeks through... finals are starting and graduation is approaching! This weekend we went on a team trip to the Oak Glen Christian Conference Center. But brothers and sisters, the deep burden on my heart right now is that we would **cooperate with God to crucify our fallen emotions**.

## Emotions are powerful

As believers, we can either live by our soul or by our regenerated spirit:

>But a soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him and he is not able to know them because they are discerned spiritually.

\- 1 Corinthians 2:14

Although the soul includes three primary parts—the mind, emotion, and will—**most soulish believers live by their emotion**. The emotion appears to occupy a greater part than the mind and the will in human life. **Nearly all the actions of soulish believers originate from their emotion**. (TSM, vol. 2, pg. 423).

## An emotional life

Human emotions fluctuate and are undependable. In a sense, all of our problems are because of our emotions: irritation, anxiety, sorrow, misery, preferences, pride, fear, hate, etc. all come out of our emotion. Suppose our day is going well—then we get into an argument with someone and are offended:

If we only had a mind and a will, our rational mind may cause us to exercise our will to simply reconcile and go about our day as usual. However, our often self-destructive emotions instead cause us to dwell on the argument and become confused, hateful, and depressed.

There is a famous hymn written by Haldor Lillenas "Glorious Freedom" which presents the real freedom we can find in Jesus, our glorious Emancipator. There are 9 lines beginning with "Freedom from…" that touch on the negative things we are freed from:

<blockquote style="background:rgb(255, 234, 234); border-left: 6px solid rgb(222, 0, 0); padding: 1.2em 1.5em; font-style: italic; font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.7; border-radius: 10px; position: relative; color: #333; box-shadow: 2px 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);">
  <p>Freedom from all the carnal affections,<br>
  Freedom from envy, hatred and strife;<br>
  Freedom from vain and worldly ambitions.<br>
  Freedom from all that saddened my life.<br>
  Freedom from pride and all sinful follies,<br>
  Freedom from love and glitter of gold;<br>
  Freedom from evil temper and anger,<br>
  Freedom from fear with all of its torments,<br>
  Freedom from care with all of its pain;</p>
</blockquote>

Every single one of these things is rooted in our emotions. "Sin's galling fetters" according to Lillenas are **entirely a product of our unreliable, nonsensical emotions**.

## Yes, nonsense

Our emotions are nonsensical. According to Watchman Nee, believers are stimulated by their emotion to do many things "beyond the bounds of the ordinary." As they quiet down and recall their actions under the influence of this function of the emotion, **they cannot help but laugh at themselves and consider themselves to have acted nonsensically**. It is very pitiful when a believer is influenced by his emotion; his spirit is powerless to subject his emotion to death and deny its control (TSM, vol. 2, pg. 427).

*The lover has no idea what she is doing because she is too emotional, living by feeling*

If you've ever watched a drama or something, you've definitely thought at some point, "Wow, that decision literally makes no sense at all." Well, that is only according to your calm, third-party perspective. But for the depicted character who is overwhelmed by emotion, practically any decision is fair game. Even look at Song of Songs: **the lover of Christ basically goes through an emotional rollercoaster in every chapter**! She loves Him, then refuses His call for silly reasons, then regrets her decision, then desperately searches, eventually finding Him again… she is truly "sick with love" (S. S. 5:8).

## We're a muddy pond

![pond](../../img/06.02.25.4.webp)

An emotional believer can be likened to a pond full of mud and sand. As long as no one comes to disturb the water, it looks clear; but once it is disturbed, it becomes muddy (TSM, vol. 2, pg. 426). Even the most trivial things can make or break his day. As long as he is undisturbed, he can enjoy God, enjoy the meetings and enjoy life. **But the moment a slight agitation arrives, he loses it**. He feels like he doesn't even love God anymore!

> He does not realize that God and God’s joy are not the same. The Holy Spirit must instruct a believer before he realizes that he has been desperately seeking God’s happiness and not God Himself when he feels dry. He does not love God; he loves the feeling which causes him to be happy (TSM, vol. 2, pg. 472-473).

## Ok what's the point of emotions then?

On the positive side, God created man with emotions in order to love and enjoy Him! Praise the Lord! 

...But due to man's fall, our emotions have been corrupted to enjoy vain, temporary pleasures apart from God. We seek after other things which make us happy: whether it's entertainment, academics, or even "godly" things. However, **we must know that “feeling” is forever a part of the soul-life**. 

When a soulish person lives by his feeling, **no matter how he feels, he is soulish**. When he feels happy, when he feels he loves the Lord, and when he feels the Lord’s presence, he is just living by his feeling. When he feels dry, sorrowful, and dark, he is still living by his feeling. **He is just as soulish when he feels dry, sorrowful, and dark as he is when he feels nourished, happy, and bright** (TSM, vol. 2, pg. 465-466).

*A spiritual man's praise is actually completely separate from his feeling. His spirit and his soul are divided. He praises the Lord for literally no reason.*

And one thing is also sure—when the things that make the soulish believer happy are taken away—he's not having a good time. One day we feel good, the next day we feel bad, the next day we feel good again, and so on. **This is not random actually, it is God's dealing**. The Song of Songs rollercoaster is not theory—it is reality.

## God's dealing

After a person is saved and is in touch with God, in the beginning the Lord causes him to feel His love, presence, and happiness. But this sweet feeling disappears after a while. When it comes back, the believer recovers his joy once more, but then it goes away again. Generally, the believer will experience this several times in his lifetime (TSM, vol. 2, pg. 466-467).

Why would God grant us happiness and then take it away? It is for us to:

| Purpose | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Know ourselves | We realize how we are easily manipulated by our emotions. In the midst of dryness, we weren't spiritual, but rather lived by our emotions. | 
| Overcome our environment | We realize that we are altogether enslaved by our environment. Our constantly changing feelings are regulated by the environment rather than God. |
| Train our will | Each time God drives us off the cliff, **we learn how to turn to Him faster, more frequently, more powerfully, and to stay turned longer**. In a sense, a life of faith is a life of a renewed will. We have no faith of our own, rather, faith is simply choosing God. |

## The highest life, a life of faith

The spiritual life is never regulated by the feeling, nor is it ever in the feeling. The spiritual life should regulate the feeling; the feeling should not regulate the spiritual life. For our feelings to dictate our faith is to put the cart before the horse. Sometimes we think we are most spiritual when we are full of feeling toward God and think we are spiritually low when we lack feeling. **Actually the extent to which we can exercise our will to choose to love God during dry periods constitutes the reality of our spiritual living**. 

| Life of feeling | Life of faith |
| --- | --- |
| Temporarily satisfied after obtaining fleeting happiness | Eternally satisfied with obtaining the eternal God |
| Lives apart from God according to themselves | Lives solely dependent on God |
| Only does God's will when happy | Always does God's will |
| Treasures a small amount of comfort | Finds perfect peace and rest in God |
| Toppled by a little loss or gain | Unshaken by massive loss or gain |

May God continue to work in each one of us and our surroundings, that **we utterly lose all trust in how we feel and instead exercise our will to choose God!!!!!!**
