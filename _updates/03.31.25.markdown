## Intro

Hello fellow coworkers in Christ. We are now 6 weeks into my fourth term, 14 weeks and less than 100 days to go! A few weeks ago I talked about [faking it through my first term](../03.10.25#faking-it). Since then, I've recorded a little jingle about that with one of my ex-roommates:

## Eating, Drinking, Breathing

Every day in the training I have to eat, drink, and breathe Jesus or else I'm basically wasting my time here. But what's the difference between these verbs? Let's try to understand by examining our physical eating, drinking, and breathing, which are shadows of the spiritual reality. 

So the full-time training has pretty good food:

![food](../../img/03.31.25.1.webp)

...but it would be difficult to eat it all without taking a sip of organic non-dairy beverage every once in a while to wash it down:

This illustrates a key principle: **in order to eat, we need to drink**[^1]. Imagine eating 40 Chicken McNuggets® without a drink—that would be terrible!

It would also be difficult to both eat and drink without breathing every once in a while. So you could say: in order to eat, we need to drink, and in order to drink, we need to breathe. Alternatively: breathing is more basic than drinking, and drinking is more basic than eating.

This doctrine seems pretty good, but in practice, how exactly do we eat, drink, and breathe?

## Practice

>I **called upon thy name, O Lord**, out of the low dungeon. Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at **my breathing**, at my cry

\- Lam. 3:55-56

Let's start simple: how do we spiritually breathe? We can breathe by **calling on the name of the Lord**. Try calling "O Lord Jesus" right now and you will find that you spontaneously took a breath! Whenever we cry out to God in this way, we both exhale and inhale. We breathe out all of our sorrows and breathe in His riches ([Hymn #255](https://www.hymnal.net/en/hymn/h/255)).

>Therefore **you will draw water** with rejoicing / From the springs of salvation, And you will say in that day, / Give thanks to Jehovah; **call upon His name**!

\- Isa. 12:3-4

Now how do we spiritually drink? We can drink by **calling on the name of the Lord**! Calling brings us into the Spirit to drink of the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:3, 13). Whenever we call, we breathe and we drink. Actually, our breathing is our drinking. Let's modify the pyramid real quick:

*Ok… I think I know where this is going*

Lastly, we eat Jesus by taking in His word (Jer. 15:16). Every morning, we can chew through and enjoy the Bible or a ministry book to enjoy our daily supply of manna. But we are also charged to **drink** the guileless milk of the word (1 Pet. 2:2). Are we drinking the word, or are we eating the word? Well actually, **our drinking is our eating**. As babies drink milk to eat, so do we drink Christ to eat Christ. So **breathing is drinking, and drinking is eating**![^2] When we call on the Lord, He is rich to us like a good ribeye steak (Rom. 10:12).

## So what's the difference?

| | Feeling of lack | Experience/Enjoyment | Expression |
| --- | --- |
| Eating | Hungry, dissatisfied | Richly satisfied | Fullness, Constitution |
| Drinking | Thirsty, dry | Refreshed, quenched | Overflow, rest |
| Breathing | Dead, weak | Enlivened, strengthened | Vitality, normal living |

Although eating, drinking, and breathing are spiritually one in essence, they emphasize different aspects of our relationship with the Lord.[^3]

Sometimes, I just **feel dead**—I realize how terrible I am, the whole world seems to be against me, and I feel there is no way out. Well, that's when I need to breathe. This is to turn to God and let out a sigh, take some deep breaths, and call on His name for a while as if I'm literally breathing. This is enough to carry me on day by day so I don't drop out of the training.

Other times, I may be preaching the gospel on campus and I just **feel dry**. I feel like I have nothing to say, and I don't want to talk to any students because they all look really sus to me that day. But silently I can call on the name of the Lord to take a drink. As I walk around, I can just keep quietly calling. Eventually, I feel refreshed, and I'm able to overflow my enjoyment of the infinite God becoming a finite man to the students.

Some other times, I may arrive at a meeting **feeling hungry**. Not only physically, but eagerly anticipating what kind of spiritual food the saints will bring and what kind of great questions the new ones will ask. After singing the first song, we may begin corporately calling on the name of the Lord. As we call, He is rich to us, and as we keep calling, we are spiritually supplied.

*It's possible that this person is eating, breathing, and drinking at the same time*

## tl;dr

If we stop and call on the name of the Lord for a minute, we may find that our calling becomes progressively richer. At first, this calling may be our breathing to enliven us. But as we keep calling, we drink. As we keep calling, we eat. In every outward situation and inward condition, we can **call on the Lord** and He will meet our need in an all-inclusive way.

<h2></h2>

[^1]: Eating is often followed by drinking in the Bible. John 6 speaks of eating the living bread, followed by John 7 which speaks of drinking the living water. Exodus 16 where the children of Israel ate the manna is followed by Exodus 17 where the children of Israel drank from the smitten rock. 1 Corinthians 10:3-4 talks about eating the same spiritual food and then drinking the same spiritual drink. It is inevitable that when we eat, we have to drink.

[^2]: "In the spiritual things, if you have the experience, you will understand that drinking is breathing, breathing is drinking, and drinking is eating [...] We all must understand that our calling on the Lord today is our breathing the Lord, our breathing the Lord is our drinking the Lord, and our drinking the Lord is our eating the Lord. When we breathe much, that is our drinking; and when we drink much, that is our eating." (CWWL, 1977, vol. 3, pg. 358)

[^3]: **Breathing** is the most basic. It just keeps us alive, and we must do it constantly. Usually people don't talk about how much they enjoy breathing. But in our deadness and tiredness, we need to breathe, as seen in the dead bones of Ezekiel 37. **Drinking** is for our dryness and always has a flow (still water signifies death in the Bible, actually). John 4 and John 7 speak of fountains of waters springing and rivers of water flowing in our being, respectively. Drinking water, while not too enjoyable, is restful (Psalm. 23:2). Drinking wine is enjoyable (Judg. 9:13; Psa. 104:15), but wine is more related to eating since it's usually served with food (e.g. bread and wine). And **eating** emphasizes a richer enjoyment of God, issuing in a substantial supply (Luke 15:23).
