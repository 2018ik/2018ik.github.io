## Intro

Hi everyone, we are now done with week 16! Only four more weeks to go (including the semiannual training) and three more weeks till graduation‚Ä¶

Anyways, this past weekend I was in Oklahoma City for my younger older brother's wedding.

## How was it?

I've been asked this question a lot today, and my response has been "it was good." Nothing super epic or life-changing IMO since it's not my wedding, but it was a very enjoyable time. Here are a few (highly) paraphrased quotes that I remember which may capture the essence of the testimony time:

## The intrinsic significance of weddings

Weddings were invented by God. Adam didn't ask God to make another female person of the same life and nature to marry him. It was God who did not like the fact that Adam was alone, so He built Eve to be his counterpart (Gen. 2:18). This was the first wedding in the Bible, and a picture of what God wanted for Himself (a bride, look up *2025 Memorial Day Conference* if you don't know what I'm talking about). 

<p style="font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 1.8; text-align: center;">
  Every time a couple looks at each other, they should be reminded that

</p>

## The non-intrinsic significance of weddings

Adam and Eve were not only the first wedded couple in the Bible, but also the first arranged marriage. Adam had no choice but to marry the one whom God had arranged for him. Technically, **every marriage is an arranged marriage**. Every proper marriage in the Bible was wonderfully arranged by God. 

**Isaac** and Rebekah found each other on that camel train with virtually no effort at all. **Jacob** had his natural desire stifled as God had arranged for him his real wife: Leah. **Joseph** also had his wife pretty much just given to him, as well as **Moses**. Ruth and **Boaz** were arranged to be together ever since God ordained for the Israelites to not reap the corners of the field for the poor (Lev. 19:9-10). The church was arranged to be married to **Christ** since at least eternity past.

Since God arranges every marriage according to His perfect will and timing, there is no reason to ever worry about getting married or who you are going to marry. To worry is to question God's sovereign arrangement. Of course, we are very weak in every aspect except to carry out fleshly works, so we cannot help but to worry.

![soul diagram](../../img/06.09.25.1.gif)
*God's operation in the soul*

But we must know that this sense of worry, anxiety, and doubt is a product of our natural emotions and **must be terminated**. If you feel your faith is strong and your spiritual life to be in ascension when your potentially God-arranged match is working out, but then lose this so-called faith and fall into a spiritual low when such a match is not working out, then you are a soulish believer. Your soul has not yet experienced enough of God's destroying work. 

God in His infinite power and wisdom can easily arrange for us the best spouse of all time who ticks every single one of our preferences, but that would be the opposite of what God wants to do in us. He doesn't want to satisfy our natural desires for us to live a soulishly happy life. **He wants to tear down everything that is natural to terminate us thoroughly**. When we have nothing except for God, He becomes our sole satisfaction.

God's goal therefore is not to provide us with the best earthly counterpart (although He does have a sovereign arrangement for each one). Rather, **His goal is to become our Husband**! You know, earthly marriage doesn't even exist in resurrection (Matt. 22:30). In eternity future, there is only one marriage, the marriage between Christ and the church. So today: just gain Christ! Just call on His sweet name every morning, every noon, every evening, every night, every meeting, every breakfast, lunch, and dinner and all your problems including the marriage ones will be solved.
