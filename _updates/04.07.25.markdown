## Intro

Ok, we are now 7 weeks into my last term, 13 weeks to go I guess. The ITERO was this weekend so I had a blast cleaning all the restrooms!

*Lunch w/ saints from the mountain states we met during the gospel trip*

A few weeks ago I talked about [how God's goal is not to make us happy](../03.10.25#gods-goal-is-not-to-make-us-happy). But while God's goal is not to make us happy, He does desire that we would be happy. 

## God's Words = Our Joy

So some of the saints from the mid-Atlantic visiting for the ITERO shared a parallel between these two verses:

>These things I have **spoken** to you that My **joy** may be in you and that your **joy** may be made full.

\- John 15:11 

>Your **words** were found and I ate them, / And Your word became to me / The gladness and **joy** of my heart...

\- Jer. 15:16

In both verses, we see God's words (i.e. His speaking) making us happy (joyful). God's words objectively existing outside of us is not going to do much for us though. We need to *receive* His word. This is to **hear** or **eat** His words. The way we receive God's words practically is by the **hearing of faith** (Rom. 10:17).

## Grace vs Faith

In my second term, we covered the Life Study of Galatians in God's economy class. Here is a very striking point from chapter 14:

>Both grace and faith refer to the same thing. <sup>1</sup>**Grace is on God’s side**, but **faith is on our side** [...] This <sup>2</sup>**faith is the appreciation, receiving, and accepting of God’s grace**. Through faith, we are joined to God’s grace, we partake of God’s grace, and we enjoy God’s grace. As we have pointed out again and again, this <sup>3</sup>**grace is the Triune God processed to become our enjoyment** and everything to us.

In the bold, we see the relationship between faith and grace<sup>1</sup>, a definition of faith<sup>2</sup>, and a definition of grace<sup>3</sup>.

1. The Word of God, who is the Son, is full of grace (John 1:14). However, since grace is on God's side, we need to be open to receive this grace.
2. Therefore, we need the hearing of faith. When we hear the Lord's grace, this grace becomes our faith, which joins us to God as grace.
3. All that God can now spread into our soul, becoming our true joy.

**God does not directly make our own joy full**. He desires to reproduce His joy in us and to make His joy, which becomes our joy, full. This is kind of like Galatians 2:20:

>**I** am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but [it is] Christ who lives in me; and the life which **I** now live...

\- Gal. 2:20

It says "I" am crucified with Christ, but "I" somehow still lives. The first "I" is the old "I," the old man (Rom. 6:6). The second "I" is a mingled "I" where God and man live in an organic union. Likewise, by being joined to God, His joy is our joy and our joy is His joy, and by making this joy full, He makes both our joy full and His joy full. You see? It's a mutual satisfaction of God and man (this is typified by how the children of Israel worshipped God in the OT...maybe next week).

I might be kind of happy if God gave me a dozen Lamborghinis, but that is fleeting and sourced in my natural emotion. He wants to first **put His joy in us** via faith, and then this joy **becomes our joy** by spreading to our soul. To partake of God's grace through faith is just to eat Jesus and eat the Word. Practically, a good place to receive the hearing of faith is the church meetings! This is the principle of John 15:11 and Jeremiah 15:16.
