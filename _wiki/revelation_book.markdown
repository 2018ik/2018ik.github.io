## Background

The revelation of Jesus Christ is the focal point of this entire book (Rev. 1:1). Revelation opens with the "revelation of Jesus Christ," indicating that this entire book reveals Christ. As the conclusion of the Bible, this is the ultimate, complete and consummate revelation of Christ and of the entire Bible. 

The contents of the Revelation are:

1. The revelation of Jesus Christ (Rev. 1:1). The main focus of its revelation is Christ, such as Him as the High Priest, the Lion-Lamb and another Angel.
2. The testimony of Jesus (Rev. 1:2), which is the church. The lampstands, woman with the man-child, harvest with its firstfruits, overcomers on the sea of glass, the bride ready for marriage, the fighting army of Christ, and the New Jerusalem are all pictures of this testimony.
3. The economy of God as His universal and eternal administration. The seven seals, seven trumpets and seven bowls represent God's administration over the earth.
