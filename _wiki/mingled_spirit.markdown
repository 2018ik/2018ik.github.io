## Background

The **mingled spirit** is the organic union of the Lord as the consummated life-giving Spirit with the human spirit, such that they become one (1 Cor. 6:17). This is the deepest mystery in the Bible, and all spiritual experiences including organic salvation are in the mingled spirit. 

## Significance

Technically speaking, when one turns to their spirit or exercises their spirit, this spirit is the mingled spirit that is one with Christ. By being one spirit with the Lord, one can know, experience and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ. The mingled spirit which is one with God is the same as God in His life and nature but not in His Godhead (1 John 5:11; 2 Pet. 1:4). However, for such a life to be expressed, one's outer man must be broken.
