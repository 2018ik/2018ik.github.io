## Background

The **mingled spirit** is the organic union of the Lord as the consummated life-giving Spirit with the human spirit, such that they become one (1 Cor. 6:17). This is the deepest mystery in the Bible, and all spiritual experiences including organic salvation are in the mingled spirit. The Body of Christ as the enlargement of God also hinges on the mingled spirit; when the Spirit - who is God - is mingled with the newly regenerated spirit of man, this spirit is added to God.

## Significance

Technically speaking, the mingled spirit is God (in life and nature but not in the Godhead). Thus, to contact God is not to communicate to a God that is without, in the word or in the heavens, but to turn to our mingled Spirit. This makes an experiential difference; exercising the mingled spirit means turning one's heart to a *person*. 

By being one spirit with the Lord, one can know, experience and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ. The mingled spirit which is one with God is the same as God in His life and nature but not in His Godhead (1 John 5:11; 2 Pet. 1:4). However, for such a life to be expressed, one's outer man must be broken.

## Occurrences in Bible

There are many verses where it is ambiguous whether *pneuma* refers to the spirit of man or the spirit of God. These are usually verses where man interacts with his spirit in some way, so it's more accurate to translate it as lowercase. However, as its a mingled spirit, using the uppercase is nonetheless correct.
