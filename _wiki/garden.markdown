## Background

A **garden** is a picture for both the individual believer and the church.
The best way to grow plants is not to douse them with water, but slowly irrigate them drop by drop over time.

## Biblical Basis

In Song of Songs, the lover of Christ is described as a garden (S.S. 4:12, 15; 5:1). As Christ's private garden, the lover is for His enjoyment and satisfaction. She also prays that both the north and south winds would come (S.S. 4:16). The north wind signifies cold, harsh and bitter environments while the south wind signifies warm, gentle and refreshing environments. The Lord uses all situations to train the believers to enjoy Him as their supply.
