## Background

The **universal priesthood** refers to all saved believers serving Him as priests (1 Pet. 2:9). The separation between clergy and laity is a custom and tradition created by man and not scriptural. 

## Significance

The universal priesthood equals each member of the Body realizing and exercising their function, resulting in the growth of the Body.

## Biblical Basis

1 Peter 2:9 establishes that all the believers are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation. Furthermore, Revelation 1:5-6 explicitly says that Christ released the believers from their sins by His blood and made them a kingdom, priests to God. For a nation to be holy, and for there to be a kingdom of priests, each citizen must be a priest.

In the Old Testament, Moses spoke on behalf of God to Pharaoh, saying "Let My people go that they may serve Me" (Exo. 8:1; 9:1). This indicates that all of the Israelites were there to serve God. God also intended the Israelites to be a kingdom of priests (Exo. 19:4). It was only due to their rebellion and failure that the Israelites lost the priesthood. After the golden calf incident, Moses asked all those who are for Jehovah to come forward, and only the Levites volunteered themselves (Exo. 32:26). Thus, only the house of Aaron and the Levites had the priestly function in the Old Testament, with the latter serving under the former (Num. 8:5-22).
