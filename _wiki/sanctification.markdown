## Background

Sanctification is to make holy, to make not common. God's sanctifying work has objective and subjective aspects.

## Types

### Positional Sanctification

Positional sanctification (PS) is to sanctify one's outward standing before God by the redeeming blood of Christ (Heb. 9:14), the Holy Spirit and the name of the Lord Jesus (1 Cor. 6:11). The common people may say certain things, go to certain places or buy certain things, but God's people cannot because they are separated and under the blood of Christ and the name of Jesus.

According to 1 Corinthians 6:11, PS occurs after washing and before justification. These steps are all included in judicial redemption.

### Dispositional Sanctification

Dispositional sanctification (DS) is to sanctify one's inward fallen nature by the Spirit organically and is deeper and more subjective than PS. While PS can take place rather easily and in a short time, DS takes a long time. First, God separates His people in PS, then He saturates us with Himself in DS.

DS is one of the eight steps of God's organic salvation, an ongoing process for a believers' perfection (Heb. 2:11; 10:14).
