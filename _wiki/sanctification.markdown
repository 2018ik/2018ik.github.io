## Background

Sanctification is to make holy, to make not common. God's sanctifying work has objective and subjective aspects.

## Types

### Positional Sanctification

Positional sanctification is to sanctify one's outward standing before God by the redeeming blood of Christ judicially.

### Dispositional Sanctification

Dispositional sanctification is to sanctify one's inward fallen nature by the Spirit organically. This is one of the eight steps of God's organic salvation, and an ongoing process for a believers' perfection (Heb. 2:11; 10:14).
