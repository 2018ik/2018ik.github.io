## Background

**Sanctification** (Greek: *hagiazo*) is the verb form of "holy" and means to make holy, or to make not common. The process of sanctification includes the entirety of God's economy. There are three steps of sanctification, beginning with God's initial choosing and consummating with the New Jerusalem, the holy city. As the New Jerusalem is a corporate entity, being made holy is also a corporate process which requires the Body of Christ.

## Interpretation

Various teachers hold different opinions about sanctification. John Wesley for example believed that sanctification was "sinless perfection." The Brethren taught that sanctification was a matter of position based on Matthew 23. The Lord said that gold was sanctified by the temple and offerings sanctified by the altar. The gold and the offerings did not change intrinsically, rather, they were sanctified by its position within the temple. This is an accurate teaching regarding positional sanctification, as seen below. However, the Bible reveals that sanctification goes the entire course of one's Christian life (Rom. 6:19, 22). Sanctification in the New Testament is through the Holy Spirit (Rom. 15:16) which operates from within, changing one's inward parts to match that of God's. While eventually sinless perfection will be exhibited, that in and of itself is not the intention of sanctification. Sanctification along with the rest of organic salvation is to work more of God's life into man.

## Three Aspects

### Seeking Sanctification

Seeking sanctification (also called initial sanctification) refers to the conviction of sinners by the Spirit unto repentance, after which one can undergo positional and dispositional sanctification. The descriptor *seeking* is used because the woman in Luke 15:8-10 signifies the Spirit, who is sweeping and seeking for an unsaved one as the lost coin. The lamp which she holds is the word of God (Psa. 119:105, 130). When we heard the gospel, God's words began to shine in us and to expose our sinful condition unto repentance and believing.

The conviction of sinners can also be seen in John 16:8-11 which says after the Lord's death, resurrection and ascension, the Spirit will come and convict the world concerning sin, righteousness and judgement. The three convictions correspond to three parties: sin is in Adam, the old creation, which we realize that we are in. Righteousness is in Christ, which we see that we lack. Judgement is for Satan and will be eternal perdition in the lake of fire, which we see that we will share if we do not repent.

The clearest proof that God's sanctifying work leads believers to repentance is in 1 Peter 1:2, which says that believers were "chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father in the sanctification of the Spirit unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ." In this verse, God's choosing is in the sanctification of the Spirit, indicating the two ar e contained in one action. While God's choosing occurs in eternity (Eph. 1:4), the Spirit's sanctification here must occur in time as it results in the obedience of men. The Spirit arranges the environment of God's chosen, unredeemed people that they would be convicted and repent.

Additional proof that God's sanctification encompasses full salvation is 2 Thessalonians 2:13, which says that God chose us from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit. This also shows that the Spirit's sanctifying work not only applies prior to one's repentance but also afterwards. This "unto" refers to a full salvation in glorification (2 Thes. 2:14). However, the Spirit's sanctifying work is only categorized as "seeking sanctification" prior to repentance.

### Positional Sanctification

Positional sanctification (PS) is to sanctify one's outward standing before God by the redeeming blood of Christ (Heb. 9:14; Heb. 13:12), the Holy Spirit and the name of the Lord Jesus (1 Cor. 6:11). The common people may say certain things, go to certain places or buy certain things, but God's people cannot because they are separated and under the blood of Christ and the name of Jesus. An example of gold being positionally sanctified is seen in Matthew 23:17; when the gold is put into the offering box, it is positionally sanctified.

According to 1 Corinthians 6:11, PS occurs after washing and before justification. These steps are all included in judicial redemption.

### Dispositional Sanctification

Dispositional sanctification (DS) is to sanctify one's inward fallen nature by the Spirit organically and is deeper and more subjective than PS. While PS can take place rather easily and in a short time, DS takes a long time. First, God separates His people in PS, then He saturates us with Himself in DS.

DS is one of the eight steps of God's organic salvation, an ongoing process for a believers' perfection (2 Thes. 2:13; Heb. 2:11; 10:14).
