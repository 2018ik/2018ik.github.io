## Background

**Sanctification** is to make holy, or to make not common. The process of sanctification includes the entirety of God's economy. There are three steps of sanctification, beginning with God's initial choosing and consummating with the New Jerusalem. As the New Jerusalem, the holy city, is a corporate entity, being made holy is also a corporate process which requires the Body of Christ. 

## Three Aspects

### Seeking Sanctification

1 Peter 1:2 says that all believers were chosen by the Father in the sanctification of the Spirit unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus christ. This means that the Spirit's sanctification is what causes sinners to be obedient and repent. We call this seeking sanctification because the second parable in Luke 15 portrays the Spirit seeking out sinners that they may repent (Luke 15:8-10). Even before being saved, all believers were swept out by the seeking Spirit.

### Positional Sanctification

Positional sanctification (PS) is to sanctify one's outward standing before God by the redeeming blood of Christ (Heb. 9:14; Heb. 13:12), the Holy Spirit and the name of the Lord Jesus (1 Cor. 6:11). The common people may say certain things, go to certain places or buy certain things, but God's people cannot because they are separated and under the blood of Christ and the name of Jesus. An example of gold being positionally sanctified is seen in Matthew 23:17; when the gold is put into the offering box, it is positionally sanctified.

According to 1 Corinthians 6:11, PS occurs after washing and before justification. These steps are all included in judicial redemption.

### Dispositional Sanctification

Dispositional sanctification (DS) is to sanctify one's inward fallen nature by the Spirit organically and is deeper and more subjective than PS. While PS can take place rather easily and in a short time, DS takes a long time. First, God separates His people in PS, then He saturates us with Himself in DS.

DS is one of the eight steps of God's organic salvation, an ongoing process for a believers' perfection (2 Thes. 2:13; Heb. 2:11; 10:14).
