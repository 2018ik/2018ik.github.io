## Background

When the Lord was alive, He was already living in the principle of the cross. In His baptism, He already showed us He died. His whole life was a life of bearing the cross. In the end of His life, He was nailed to the cross. 

We got nailed to the cross first, we have been crucified with Christ. In His death, He included us. The Lord's death is an all-inclusive death, including all creation. We begin with nailing the cross, but then we need to deny ourselves, pick up the cross, and to follow Him.
