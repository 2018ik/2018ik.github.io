## Background

The **cross** of Christ is God's way of terminating the old creation that the life of Jesus can be manifested (1 Cor. 4:10-12). To take up the cross and follow the Lord is for the self, natural life, and old man to be terminated (Matt. 16:24). Outwardly, this may appear to be suffering, but inwardly, it is actually an enjoyment. With the termination and death of the old man, which is the initial step, follows the resurrection of the new man (1 Pet. 2:24; Rom. 6:5). This new resurrection life, a mingled, grafted life joined to Christ in an organic union, is true enjoyment. 

Eventually, the life of Jesus may be manifested in one's mortal flesh (2 Cor. 4:11). The operation of death in this way that the natural life can be killed and resurrected in glory (2 Cor. 4:12) is true bearing of the cross. This is not a one time bearing of some tough situation, and the end result is not a successful navigation through the situation, but the dispositional change which operates in the believers.   

When the Lord was alive, He was already living in the principle of the cross. In His baptism, He already showed us He died. His whole life was a life of bearing the cross. In the end of His life, He was nailed to the cross. 

We got nailed to the cross first, we have been crucified with Christ. In His death, He included us. The Lord's death is an all-inclusive death, including all creation. We begin with nailing the cross, but then we need to deny ourselves, pick up the cross, and to follow Him.

## Significance

While Christ is the center of God's economy, the cross is the center of the operation of God's economy. 

While the blood cleanses objectively, the cross purifies subjectively. This is to break down all of one's natural concepts and goals to solely pursue God. 

The imparting of life is actually always due to suffering the killing of the cross.
