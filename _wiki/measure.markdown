## Background

A believer's **measure** refers to the particular capacity which the God of measure has apportioned to them. This measure can be a person's spiritual capacity, gifts, intelligence, family situation, work situation and any kind of outward circumstances sovereignly measured by God. To not boast *beyond* one's measure indicates that to have a measure is to be restricted (2 Cor. 10:13). Each member of the Body of Christ has its own measure, which operates for the growth of the Body (Eph. 4:16).

On one hand, each member should exercise to use the measure they are given to the full (2 Tim. 4:5). On the other hand, they must stay within their measure. For example, in the clergy-laity system, the clergy are no doubt extending beyond their measure, while the laity are using very little of their measure. 

## Measuring in Ezekiel 47

The measuring in Ezekiel 47 refers to God's examining, testing and judging His people in order to possess them. This is different from the general NT definition of measuring in two ways:

1) It is not God measuring out a certain amount of something but God measuring what already exists
2) It is solely an inward measuring of His people

Before we buy something, we always test it out prior to purchasing. Likewise, God "tests" us out through trials and tribulations to see where we are at. We must have the grace for the Lord to measure us. Only then can we have the flowing of the grace of life (Ezek. 47:4-6).
