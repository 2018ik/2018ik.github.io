## Background

A believer's **measure** refers to the particular function which the God of measure as apportioned to them (2 Cor. 10:13). Each one of the Body of Christ has its own measure, which operates for the growth of the Body (Eph. 4:16). Each member must exercise to use their measure to the full (2 Tim. 4:5).

One must stay within their measure. On the other hand, it would be suboptimal to use too little of one's measure. For example, in the clergy-laity system, the clergy are no doubt extending beyond their measure, while the laity are using very little of their measure.

## Measuring

God measures His people in order to examine, test and judge their measure, in order to possess them. Before we buy something, we always test it out prior to purchasing. Likewise, God "tests" us out through trials and tribulations to see where we are at. We must have the grace for the Lord to measure us. Only then can we have the flowing of the grace of life (Ezek. 47:4-6).
