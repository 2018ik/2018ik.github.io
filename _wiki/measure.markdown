## Background

A believer's **measure** refers to the particular function which the God of measure as apportioned to them (2 Cor. 10:13). Each one of the Body of Christ has its own measure, which operates for the growth of the Body (Eph. 4:16). Each member must exercise to use their measure to the full (2 Tim. 4:5).

One must stay within their measure. On the other hand, it would be suboptimal to use too little of one's measure. For example, in the clergy-laity system, the clergy are no doubt extending beyond their measure, while the laity are using very little of their measure.
