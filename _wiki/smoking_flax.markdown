## Background

The **smoking flax** in Matthew 12:20 refers to the flax torches used by Jews in that era, which burn oil. When the oil runs out, the flax smokes, and it is quenched. There are many called by the Lord who initially cannot produce a shining light, but those who are chosen will be perfected by the Lord.
