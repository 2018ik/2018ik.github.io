>"...I will put My law in their inward parts..."

\- Jer. 31:33

## Background

Inward parts refers to parts of our being which are within our soul. On the other hand, the *hidden* parts of man, mentioned in Psalm 51:6 must refer specifically to the human spirit.

## Biblical Basis

We see in Jeremiah 31:33 that God will put His law in their inward parts. In the same verse, God also says that he will write His law upon their heart.

On the other hand, Hebrews 8:10 says "I will impart My laws into their mind." This means that the mind is one of the inward parts.

The term inward parts is used in the Scriptures more than once. For example, Psalm 51:6 says, "Behold, You delight in truth in the inward parts." The inward parts must have truth. Besides the inward parts there is another part in this psalm called the hidden part: "And in the hidden part You would make known wisdom to me." The truth is in the inward parts, but wisdom is in the hidden part.
