## Background

Paul wrote the epistle to the Galatians iin approximately A.D. 54, after traveling through Galatia and arriving in Corinth.
During this time, the Galatians were distracted by the law keepers, or Judaizers who treasured the law more than the gospel. 

## Summary



## Significance

Many think the book of Galatians is about justification by faith vs law, but the focus is actually the indwelling Christ: Christ revealed in us, living in us, and being formed in us.

## Christ Dwells In Man

Galatians 2:20 says not I by Christ who lives in me. This is to take Christ as our life and everything. He is the human virtues we express in every minute detail of our life.
