## Background

Paul wrote the epistle to the **Galatians** in approximately A.D. 54, after traveling through Galatia and arriving in Corinth. This is the first of four books which can be said to make up the "heart" of the New Testament: Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians. Many think the book of Galatians is about justification by faith versus law, but the focus is actually the indwelling Christ: Christ revealed in them (Gal. 1:16), living in them (Gal. 2:20), and being formed in them (Gal. 4:19).

On the negative side, Paul speaks against three things: the law, religion, and the flesh.

During this time, the Galatians were distracted by the law keepers, or Judaizers who treasured the law more than the gospel; this was called the "present evil age" (Gal. 1:4). Paul reveals to them that justification is not through the law, and that to keep the law is contrary to God's economy. Actually, Galatians is the most basic book in the Bible with respect to God's New Testament economy not being out of the law but by faith. In comparison, Colossians deals with the Christian experience, while Galatians deals with the basic truths. Romans touches similar topics, but expounds more on organic salvation and the normal practical church life, while Galatians makes it more clear than any other book the fundamental truth that New Testament believers are freed from the law in Christ as His children.

### Blessing of Abraham

The blessing promised to Abraham was for all the families of the earth to be blessed (Gen. 12:3), and this blessing is the promise of the Spirit. The Spirit was promised to be given to all the nations. This was fulfilled by Christ who became the life-giving Spirit to indwell man i.e. to be received by man.
