## Background

Paul wrote the epistle to the Galatians iin approximately A.D. 54, after traveling through Galatia and arriving in Corinth.
During this time, the Galatians were distracted by the law keepers, or Judaizers who treasured the law more than the gospel. 

## Summary

See: [Galatians chapters](../galatians_chapters)

## Significance

Many think the book of Galatians is about justification by faith vs law, but the focus is actually the indwelling Christ: Christ revealed in them (Gal. 1:16), living in them (Gal. 2:20), and being formed in them (Gal. 4:19).
