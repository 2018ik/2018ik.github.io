## Background

Many think the book of Galatians is about justification by faith vs law, but the focus is actually the indwelling Christ: Christ revealed in us, living in us, and being formed in us.

## Christ Dwells In Man

Galatians 2:20 says not I by Christ who lives in me. This is to take Christ as our life and everything. He is the human virtues we express in every minute detail of our life.
