## Background

Paul wrote the epistle to the **Galatians** in approximately A.D. 54, after traveling through Galatia and arriving in Corinth.

During this time, the Galatians were distracted by the law keepers, or Judaizers who treasured the law more than the gospel; this was called the "present evil age" (Gal. 1:4). Paul reveals to them that justification is not through the law, and that to keep the law is contrary to God's economy. Actually, Galatians is the most basic book in the Bible with respect to God's New Testament economy. In comparison, Colossians deals with the Christian experience, while Galatians deals with the basic truths. Romans touches similar topics, but expounds more on organic salvation and the normal practical church life, while Galatians makes it more clear than any other book the fundamental truth that New Testament believers are freed from the law in Christ as His children.

## Significance

Many think the book of Galatians is about justification by faith vs law, but the focus is actually the indwelling Christ: Christ revealed in them (Gal. 1:16), living in them (Gal. 2:20), and being formed in them (Gal. 4:19).
