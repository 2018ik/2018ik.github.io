## Background

## 19

Zaccheus was a chief tax collector who climbed a sycamore tree in order to get the Lord's attention, after which the Lord stayed in His house. Although Zaccheus was sinful, and rich, he told the Lord that he would give half his possessions to the poor and to restore four times as much to those whom he has taken anything by false accusation. Although the Lord proceeded to tell Zaccheus that salvation has come to this house, salvation had already come to Zaccheus before he determined to give away his money. The power of God's salvation causes the believers to clear away and end their former lives; this kind of clearance is an issue of one's enjoyment of salvation, not a prerequisite for salvation.
