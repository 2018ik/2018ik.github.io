"But to us God has revealed them through the Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God."

\- 1 Cor. 2:10

## Background

The depths of God in 1 Cor. 2:10 refers to the deep things of God. What man regards are superficial things in the physical realm; it is imperative to know God according to the divine matters that God regards as deep. This includes the riches, wisdom and knowledge of God (Rom. 11:33), concepts which are beyond the comprehension of our natural senses.

However, in the context of the whole book, the depths of God refers to the all-inclusive Christ, who as the life-giving Spirit indwells our spirit (Rom. 8:11). The Corinthians were unable to know Christ as the depths of God because of they fleshly and soulish behavior.

## Christ

The deep things of God is a person: Christ in many aspects as our eternal portion (1 Cor. 2:6-10). The know these depths requires advancing in our experiencing of the all-inclusive Christ. 

## How to Enter

We are able to enter into the depths of God because of God's wisdom, which is in a mystery that is Christ, who predestinated us unto glory. This predestination allows us to be regenerated, which allows us to use our human spirit and to love God, the two keys to revealing the depths of God (1 Cor 2:9, 10).

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>The depths of God cannot be realized and discerned by our philosophical mind, which is really small. But praise God we have a wise God. His wisdom which is hidden in a mystery, which is Christ, who predestinated us unto glory to be His sons, regenerated us to contact God and to love God with our mingled spirit to enjoy Him continually and enter into His depths progressively. We can let our entire being be occupied by Him and be lost in Him. In this way we can enter into Christ not in a superficial way, but into the deep and hidden things of God.
