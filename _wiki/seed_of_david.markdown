## Background

**Seed of David** implies Christ in His humanity. That means the very Christ in incarnation became a man. The Lord was in the likeness of flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3), but did not have sin inwardly, much like the bronze serpent in Exodus. 

Christ in His humanity did not have the poison, or the element, but he had the involvement because He was according to flesh (Rom. 1:3). He lived a certain way, and through His death, he took care of the negative involvements of the flesh.
