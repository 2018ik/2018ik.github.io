## Background

**Glorification** is to be saturated with the divine glory from within in the maturity of the divine life and to be glorified externally with the divine glory as the final step of organic salvation (Rom. 8:30). This is also called the redemption of the body, the outermost, external part of the tripartite man (Rom. 8:23; Eph. 4:30).
