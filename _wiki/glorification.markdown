## Background

**Glorification** is to be completely saturated with the divine glory from within and without in the maturity of the divine life and nature as the final step of organic salvation (Rom. 8:30). This is also called the redemption of the body, redemption of the outermost, external part of the tripartite man (Rom. 8:23; Eph. 4:30). God begins in the spirit, and works in the soul, being expressed through our mind, emotion and will. Then, He even gives life to our mortal bodies (Rom. 8:11). Glorification is the full saturation of God's life in every part of one's being.
