## Background

To **constrain** is to forcibly limit from all sides and is synonymous with "compel." Thus, the love of Christ should compel and forcibly limit us in our daily walk (2 Cor. 5:14).  This love takes away the choice and preference of the natural life. The life which one lives as a result of being constrained by God's love is no longer of themselves or toward themselves, but [to the Lord](../living_to_the_lord) (Rom. 14:7-8; Gal. 2:20).
