## Background

The soul refers to one's mind, emotion and will. Through the soul, one can interact with the psychological realm.

## Significance

The divine attributes of God are manifest through the soul. We can't express God with just the spirit. Through the soul we can reflect the Lord (2 Cor. 3:18).

## Biblical Basis

### Mind

Proverbs 2:10 says that knowledge will be pleasant to the soul, and Psalm 139:14 says that the soul knows. Knowing is a function of the mind.

Furthermore, Psalm 13:2 shows that one can take counsel in their soul. Analyzing or considering the best decision is a function of the mind. Lamentations 3:20 shows that the soul can remember things, and remembrance is also a function of the mind.

### Emotion

The soul exhibits many emotions throughout the Bible, indicating that man's emotion is part of the soul:
1. Love (1 Sam. 18:1, S.S. 1:7, Psa. 42:1)
2. Hate (2 Sam. 5:8, Psa. 107:18, Ezek. 36:5). 
3. Joy (Isa. 61:10, Psa. 86:4)
4. Grief (1 Sam. 30:6, Judg. 10:16)
5. Desire (1 Sam. 20:4, Deut. 14:26, Ezek. 24:25, Jer. 44:14)

### Will

The soul can choose (Job 7:15), refuse (Job 6:7), and seek after things (1 Chron. 22:19). These are functions of man's will. Numbers 30 also talks about binding one's soul, which in context we can see is a matter of making a vow, which is to do with man's will. The Hebrew word *soul* is also occasionally translated into *will* based on context (Psa. 27:12; 41:2).
