## Background

The **pagan tribes** in the good land signify the natural life. The gods and idols of these tribes and the demons behind them represent the spiritual forces of evil (Eph. 6:12). God promised to drive out the pagan tribes however the children of Israel had to cooperate with God in order to carry this out (Exo. 23:31-33). Furthermore, God drove out the tribes over time, which indicates that the cutting off of the natural life must be gradual according to the degree of growth in the divine life.
