## Background

**Incarnation** refers to God becoming flesh (John 1:14), coming in the likeness of the flesh of sin (Romans 8:3). He then lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, wherein the first thirty years were that of a poor Nazerene in a despised place. When God the Father sent His Son, the Father did not stay in heaven, but the Father is with the Son and one with the Son (John 8:29).

## Significance

God became a man, bringing finite God into finite man, so that He could dispense Himself into us, to be our grace and reality in order that we can enjoy Him and realize Himself as everything in us.

The incarnation of the Lord Jesus establishes the principle for the speaking of God's Word. This is the Word becoming flesh. The Word was absolutely heavenly, but now it's not in heaven, it is now on earth as the apostles speak. 

## Limitations

The eternal Father's physical entering into of the realm of time and space came with  certain human limitations. This would continue until His death and resurrection, after which the divine life within His human shell was released (John 12:24), designating Him as the Son of God in power (Rom. 1:4) and giving Him a spiritual body with which He could phase through doors.

### Knowledge

He was limited in knowledge (Matt. 24:36; Luke 2:40), as He had to grow in physical age and wisdom. 

### Glory

The human shell of Jesus concealed the glory of the Father.
