## Background

Incarnation refers to God becoming flesh (John 1:14), coming in the likeness of the flesh of sin (Romans 8:3). He then lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, wherein the first thirty years were that of a poor Nazerene in a despised place.

## Significance

God became a man, bringing finite God into finite man, so that He could dispense Himself into us, to be our grace and reality in order that we can enjoy Him and realize Himself as everything in us. When God the Father sent His Son, the Father did not stay in heaven (see: modalism), but the Father is with the Son and one with the Son (John 8:29).

## Principle of Incarnation

The incarnation of the Lord Jesus establishes the principle for the speaking of God's Word. This is the Word becoming flesh. The Word was absolutely heavenly, but now it's not in heaven, it is now on earth as the apostles speak.
