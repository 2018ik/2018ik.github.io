## Background

**Incarnation** refers to God becoming flesh (John 1:14) and entering into both time and humanity in the likeness of the flesh of sin (Romans 8:3), fully possessing both divine and human natures in a hypostatic union. The eternal God's physical entering into of the realm of time and space came with certain human limitations. The Lord in His humanity was limited in knowledge (Matt. 24:36; Luke 2:40), as He had to grow in physical age and wisdom. His human shell also concealed the glory of the Father. Furthermore, His humanity had yet to be elevated into divinity until His resurrection, which is why He was able to die in the first place (the divine, uncreated *zoe* life cannot die).

As He lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, wherein the first thirty years were that of a poor Nazerene in a despised place. The Son lived a life fully according to the Father's will. When God the Father sent His Son, the Father did not stay in heaven, but the Father was with the Son and one with the Son (John 8:29). This would continue until His death and resurrection, after which the divine life within His human shell was released (John 12:24), designating Him the Son of God in power (Rom. 1:4) and giving Him a spiritual body. God incarnated to bring divinity into humanity, and He resurrected and ascended to bring humanity back into divinity, even becoming the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Now, He is able to enter into man and give man to transform us to be the same as God in every way apart from the Godhead (2 Cor. 3:17-18).

## Purpose

God's heart desire in creating man is that He would have a corporate person to match Him, that is His counterpart. In order to elevate man to match Him, man needs to be made the same as God in life and nature. For example, we as humans would never marry a non-human creature. Therefore, in order to match man, God must add Himself to man to make man God. In order to this, He had to go through incarnation for the following reasons:

1. Man has fallen into sin, and this sin must be removed through Christ's redemption
2. God in His divinity dwells in unapproachable light and cannot reach man in His divinity
3. Even if God could in His divinity inject Himself directly into man (this is a hypothetical scenario that goes beyond the scope of the Bible, but is potentially logically sound), then man would be both human and divine while God Himself would be only divine. Thus, there still is not an equality in life and nature.

Through incarnation, divinity was added to humanity so that through death, and resurrection, humanity could be [compounded into divinity, into the Spirit](../holy_anointing_oil). This produced the suitable prototype through which God can achieve His mass reproduction.

## Significance

God becoming a man is the first economical step in the full ministry of Christ: bringing the finite God into finite man, so that He could dispense Himself into us, to be our grace and reality in order that we can enjoy Him and realize Himself as everything in us.

The incarnation of the Lord Jesus establishes the principle for the speaking of God's Word. This is the Word becoming flesh. The Word was absolutely heavenly, but now it's not in heaven, it is now on earth as the apostles' speaking.  

## Principle

The principle of incarnation is that God expresses Himself solely through the Son as His embodiment, in contrast to do the many prophets in the Old Testament age  (Heb. 1:1-2). God first spoke in the Son as a man in the four Gospels (John 14:10). Then, He spoke in the Son as the Spirit through the apostles in Acts and the epistles (Heb. 2:3-4; 2 Pet. 3:15-16). Then, He spoke in the Son as the seven Spirits through John in Revelation (Rev. 1:2). Today, He speaks in the Son corporately, speaking in the enlarged corporate Christ, the divine incorporation of God and man (1 Cor. 12:12).

## Caveats

According to man's view economically, Christ's incarnation occurred 2000 years ago. However, according to God's view essentially, Christ was incarnated and slain before the foundation of the world (Rev. 13:8). This is because Christ was [incarnated as a creature in eternity past](../firstborn_of_all_creation).
