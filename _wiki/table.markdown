>"So then let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."

\- 1 Cor. 5:8

## Background

The Lord's table actually implies the entire New Testament economy, which involves the processed consummated Triune God dispensing Himself into us as the Spirit to be our life supply to produce the church as the organic Body of Christ.

To remember the Lord by the table is not to meditate on his processes merely in our mind, it's to exercise our mingled spirit to eat and drink the Lord. **If we ever feel that our love for the Lord is waning, we need to feel the undying love of the Lord for us displayed on the table.**

## The Two Elements

> "He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me and I in him."

\- John 6:56

The Lord's table consists of two elements: the bread and the cup (of wine), which represents the Lord's flesh and blood respectively. The bread signifies the Lord's body which was broken for us to release te divine life to us so that we may partake of Him as life and life supply. The cup is the new covenant established in the Lord's own blood, which is related to redemption.

Intrinsically, flesh and blood are both human elements, which represents his incarnation. Furthermore, the breaking of the bread, as well as the separation of bread and wine represents the death of Christ and the shedding of blood.

### Bread

In order for the Lord Jesus to be eaten by us, He needed to die on the cross. The breaking of the bread remembers the physical body of the Lord being broken. When we hear the sound of the bread breaking, our hearts should move, and we should realize the suffering the Lord went through because He loved us.

The bread refers to the Lord's body composed of the many believers. We are the one Body because we all partake of the one bread, which constitutes each member with the same Christ (1 Cor 10:17). 

A superficial description of a believer in Christ may simply go to church every week. However, to be a genuine member, we need to eat, digest and assimilate Christ. This is symbolized by the bread of life.

### Cup

To drink the cup is to review te redemption of the new covenant (Matt. 26:28), and to have fellowship in the blood of Christ (1 Cor. 10:16a).

## To Partake

>"For as often as you eat and drink the cup, you declare the Lord's death until He comes."

\- 1 Cor 11:26

By partaking of the cup as the fellowship of the blood of Christ and the bread as the fellowship of the body of Christ we remember

We need to be saved from idols, which are signified by the demons' table (1 Cor. 10:21). 

People from the world drink away their problems - with alcohol, with various other distractions. By partaking of the Lord at His table, he becomes our full satisfaction.

## Table Meeting

>"And one the first day of the week, when we gathered together to break bread..."

\- Acts 20:7

The table meeting is the most important meeting of the church, as it is the meeting which the Lord Jesus Himself instituted. This is the New Testament replacement of the feast of the passover, as the first day of the feast of the unleavened bread was the same as the feast of the passover. The Lord Jesus is the reality of the passover (1 Cor 5:??).

### Lord's Supper

The Lord's supper is actually different from the Lord's table (1 Cor. 11:20). The table is for our enjoyment of Him while the Lord's supper is for His satisfaction.

## Testimonies

### Testimony \#1

> I've always took the Lord superficially at the table, but I was convicted by the Lord for the many substitutes I had for Him. For example, my work and my negative feelings toward my wife. Only after dealing with these things was I able to partake and enter into the enjoyment. 
> 
> You and You alone should be unique constituent of my being. Lord I repent for feeding on so many other things, so many substitutes for Christ. Grant me to be poor in spirit, grant me to be unloaded of any anxieties in my heart that I can be filled with you exclusively that you can be one constituent of my being. 
> 
> Since the bread signifies Your one mystical universal body, I must live in peace with every member of the body of Christ and enjoy you as the peace offering in relation to every member of body of Christ. Help me to see the treasure in earthen vessels - I don't want to look at the clay element which resides in us with my physical eyes; enlighten my heart to see the priceless treasure in every brother and sister. 

### Testimony \#2

>A number of years ago a well meaning saint purchased two tickets for my family to see the play "Christmas Carol" one saturday afternoon. I was trying not to be late since I didn't want a significant price paid by this dear saint to go to waste and I was getting a little nervous because there was considerable traffic that I didn't forsee. But the Lord seemed to be saying in a very living way: "Don't you see there's a feast that I've prepared by paying the highest price that is My precious blood?"
>
>It is by the precious blood of Christ that the new covenant was established so that we may drink of the cup of blessing the cup of salvation in which God in Christ is our eternal portion and our inheritance. I was so convicted - oh Lord save me from my indifference to the table meeting. I would like to honor your table, honor your supper. What is this clay to the feast of love divine?
