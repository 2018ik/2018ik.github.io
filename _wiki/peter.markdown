>"Peter is our representative. Peter is you, Peter is me."

\-M.C.

## Background

**Peter** was one of the twelve disciples of Jesus. He was one who followed and loved Jesus, yet was also natural, strong and overconfident in his self. Thus, he had to be trained for three years by the Lord to deny his self.

## History


Peter rebuked the Lord after He said He was to die (Matt. 16:21-22). This was because he loved the Lord and did not want Him to die. This however was a natural love, which was actually satanic (Matt. 16:23). 

### Post-crucifixion

Jesus asked Peter three times if he loved Him. This is in parallel to the three times which Peter denied the Lord's name.

> There are times in ym folowwing oft he Lord that I want d to quit. The fialure was just too much. I wanted to throw in the towel. Sometimes for different reasons, sometimes I still haven't learned after so long what I am good for. Other times, Lord you certainly called the wrong person. Someone else is a lot better. There are times how can I keep doing this? And still be qualified to be your follower to serve you? There are other times I'm just plain tired, just wasted just when will this end? You know people say Lord come quickly except their come quickly is to "come quickly before I quit." You know, I've experienced this. Now 50 60 years later i'm still here, all I can say is that someone has been praying, and I don't mean you. Someone, who lives to intercede for all of us. Scott you can be done, someone is praying. And not just tonight, 10 years from now, 30 years from now, if the Lord tarries, 50 years from now, he will still be praying. And as for Peter, the Lord's way of restoring him surely he was gone, the Lord's way of restoring him is always through love. time and time again there has to be some breakinf, some exposing, that you can bring me to a point to conclude forget it, im no good, i am not a follower of Cheist. when toy are at that pont the lord comes firstly to do miracles, then feed you. and then not to come and love hou but to come and ask you about your loce for him. the lord didnt say i still love you, the lord said, do you love me. the question is always who is these. do you love me more.than thss? to this day im still not 100% sure but i thibk this these could refer to his fellow followers  the other disciples, the ones next to you.  its almost like a negative question, meaning can you still say lord if they all quit ill stand still next to you. can you love me like that? its very personal, the lord was not talking to any other one . can gou still say you love me more than others? thats why peter couldnt say that, he didnt know anymore, only you know. he wasnt better than anybody, he wasnt stronger than any body. how tender this was.
