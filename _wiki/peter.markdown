>"Peter is our representative. Peter is you, Peter is me."

\-M.C.

## Background

**Peter** (or Simon or Cephas) was one of the twelve disciples of Jesus. He was one who followed and loved Jesus, yet was also natural, strong and overconfident in his self. Thus, he had to be trained for three years by the Lord to deny his self.

## History

Peter rebuked the Lord after He said He was to die (Matt. 16:21-22). This was because he loved the Lord and did not want Him to die. This however was a natural love, which was actually satanic (Matt. 16:23). Peter was essentially telling the Lord not to redeem His people, enact the new covenant, and resurrect as the life-giving Spirit to make all of His riches known to mankind.

Jesus asked Peter three times if he loved Him. This is in parallel to the three times which Peter denied the Lord's name.

In Acts 10, Peter spoke a foolish word when a trace came upon him. The Lord showed a vessel descending from heaven with all the animals, but Peter refused to eat what was common and unclean (Acts 10:14). This was according to Old Testament principles, indicating that Peter had not fully seen the vision. He did not realize that the Lord on the cross had abolished all the laws of ordinances (Eph. 2:15). Ho

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

> There are times in my following of the Lord that I wanted to quit. The failure was just too much. I wanted to throw in the towel. Sometimes for different reasons, sometimes I still haven't learned after so long what I am good for. Other times, I think, "Lord you certainly called the wrong person. Someone else is a lot better." There are times when I think, "How can I keep doing this? And still be qualified to be your follower to serve you?" There are other times I'm just plain tired, just wasted, just when will this end? You know people say Lord come quickly except their come quickly is to "come quickly before I quit." I've experienced this.

> Now, 50 to 60 years later I'm still here. All I can say is that someone has been praying, and I don't mean you. Someone who lives to intercede for all of us. Scott - you can be done, but Someone is praying. And not just tonight, 10 years from now, 30 years from now, if the Lord tarries, 50 years from now, He will still be praying. And as for Peter, the Lord's way of restoring him was always through love. Time and time again there has to be some breaking, some exposing, that you can bring me to a point of exhaustion - "Forget it, I'm no good, I am not a follower of Christ." when you are at that point the Lord comes firstly to do miracles, then feed you. And then not to come and love you but to come and ask you about your love for him. The Lord didn't say I still love you (to Peter), the Lord said, "Do you love me?" The question is always "Do you love me more than these?" To this day I'm still not 100% sure but I think this these could refer to his fellow followers, the other disciples, the ones next to you. I'ts almost like a negative question, meaning can you still say: "Lord if they all quit, I'll stand still next to you." Can you love Him like that? It's very personal; that's why Peter couldn't answer straightly, he didn't know anymore, only You know. He wasn't better than anybody, he wasn't stronger than anybody. How tender this was.
