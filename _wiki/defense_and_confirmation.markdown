## Background

The goal of this project is twofold: on the negative side, to defend the gospel and resist perverting and distorting heresies, and on the positive side, to confirm the gospel and its revelations of God's mysteries concerning Christ and the church. The end goal is not to fight doctrine for the sake of doctrine, but to fight for the reality, which is the enjoyment of the Triune God.

## History

See spiritual warfare.

## Four Methods

When dealing with opposition, we should not argue, but simply present the truth, which requires being constituted with the truth.

1. Writing way
   1. Make the truth and facts clear through responding to and publishing articles 
2. Christian way
   1. Developing relationships with churches and Christian groups
3. Proactive way
   1. Working with churches and coworkers on college campuses
4. Legal way
   1. Research to assist coworkers in caring for situations among the churches

## Q & A

>What is the greatest threat that the Lord's Recovery is facing at present?

We have not been challenged on the truth for probably a decade, but we feel right now the greatest threat kind of involves both inside and outside. In other words, the unrestrained use of social media and people expressing their grievances, their opinions. There are many unsubstantiated downright false accusations that are being made on social media. If you can't win regarding the truth, you attack the persons, the ministers. This I'd say is the greatest threat today.

>What is the greatest opportunity you all have seen to opening fellowship to those outside the Lord's Recovery?

One of the ways for addressing opposition was the "proactive" way. This is a portion that DCP among other serving ones have pursued and what this involves is contacting those that can be of some benefit and provide a testimony. Through such ones, this has really cleared the ground in many respects in the beginning and mid 2000s to the present day. When respected ones in Christianity say something positive concerning the Recovery others who respect them are muh less likely to say something themselves. So even just reducing the amount that is said with regards to opposition is a huge help. I would say the big need is those burdened to participate in this.

>How should I, as a positive one in the Lord's Recovery, handle something negative that I encounter online?

>First thing is don't encounter it - stay as much as possible away from the negative things. Don't think this is just information, but there is something poisonous here that will kill our enjoyment and put questions in us. There is something in all of us that is susceptible to negative thinking. 

If you do encounter something, the first thing you should do is fellowship. Resist the temptation to just try to judge the matter yourself. If something gets into you and raises questions in you and bothers you, fellowship with someone more mature. One of the accusations is that we don't want questions, but that's a lie. What we don't want is *questioning* or endless questionings that aren't even seeking for an answer.
