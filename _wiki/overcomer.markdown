The overcomers are who will bring the Lord back in His second coming.

## Biblical Basis

### Revelation

In Revelation 19, prior to the millenial kingdom mentioned in Revelation 20:6, the overcoming believers are typified by the bride of Christ, who fight with Christ to defeat Antichrist and the false prophet and cast them both into the lake of fire (Rev. 19:20), while Satan is locked up in the abyss (Rev. 20:3).
