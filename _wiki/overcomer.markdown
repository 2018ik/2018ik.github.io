## Background

**Overcomers** are believers who lived the proper Christian life of running the race to gain Christ (1 Cor. 9:24) and have fought the good fight against Satan and his kingdom of darkness for God's kingdom (Eph. 6:10-19). These are they who love the Lord with the first love, are empowered by the Lord, and enjoy the Lord who set them as a seal on His heart and His arm (S.S. 8:6).

The overcomers can be likened to a beachhead which the Lord can use as the starting point for His gaining of the earth.

## Significance

The overcomers are those who will bring the Lord back in His second coming.

## Biblical Basis

### Revelation

In Revelation 19, prior to the millennial kingdom mentioned in Revelation 20:6, the overcoming believers are typified by the bride of Christ, who fight with Christ to defeat Antichrist and the false prophet and cast them both into the lake of fire (Rev. 19:20), while Satan is locked up in the abyss (Rev. 20:3).

## Application

To be an overcomer is a matter of one's daily, normal living, not the accomplishment of any particular outward milestones. These life practices include:

1. Consecrating oneself each morning (Phil. 3:13-14)
2. Spending time with the Lord privately every day (Matt. 14:22-23; 6:6)
3. Enjoy the Lord in the Word ever day early in the morning (Psa. 119:147-148)
4. Deal with sins thoroughly (1 John 1:7, 9)
5. Maintain fellowship with the Lord moment by moment by living a life of prayer (2 Cor. 13:14; Phil. 4:6-7)
6. Redeem the time, spending energy to be soaked with God's Word (2 Tim. 3:16-17; Col. 3:16)
7. Rejoicing always, praying unceasingly giving thanks in everything (Eph. 5:18; 1 Thes. 5:16-19)
8. Be dominated, governed, directed, moved and lead by the Spirit (2 Cor. 2:13)
9. Live in the presence of Christ (2 Cor. 2:10; 4:6-7)
10. Receive Christ as grace (2 Cor. 12:7-10; 13:14)
