## Background

**Overcomers** refer to a small part of the believers who are qualified for the kingdom reward through running the race to lay hold of the prize (1 Cor. 9:24; Matt. 22:14). In the millennium, the overcomers will be with Christ in the wedding feast while the defeated believers will suffer discipline in outer darkness to be perfected.

## Significance

The overcomers are those who will bring the Lord back in His second coming.

## Revelation

The book of Revelation reveals two kinds of overcomers: those who are still alive during the second coming, and those who have passed. Those who have passed are part of the man-child, and those who are still living are raptured as the firstfruits. Both of these groups will fight against Antichrist and his armies in Revelation 17, and enter into the marriage feast of Christ in Revelation 19, during which the Antichrist, the false prophet, and their armies are defeated.

### Seven Churches

In the seven churches in Revelation, the overcomers were those who could overcome the degraded situation of their church, and each received a reward (Rev. 2:7). These rewards are on top of one's initial salvation and are awarded based on works. As the condition of these churches are an admonishment to believers today, one must likewise overcome such degradations today e.g. losing the first love (Rev. 2:4). 

Believers today must overcome all the situations mentioned in the seven churches, as well as the world (1 John 5:4-5), the evil one, Satan (1 John 2:13-14), and the spirit of the antichrist (1 John 4:3-4). These are believers who have fought the good fight against Satan for God's kingdom, finished their course and kept the faith to the end (2 Tim. 4:7-8; Eph. 6:10-19). These are they who love the Lord with the first love, are empowered by the Lord, and enjoy the Lord who set them as a seal on His heart and His arm (S.S. 8:6).

### Finale

In Revelation 19, prior to the millennial kingdom mentioned in Revelation 20:6, the overcoming believers are typified by the bride of Christ, who fight with Christ to defeat Antichrist and the false prophet and cast them both into the lake of fire (Rev. 19:20), while Satan is locked up in the abyss (Rev. 20:3).

## Application

Most try to overcome in their flesh, which is impossible. Furthermore, God will not answers prayers of those who wish to overcome by means of themselves, e.g. "Lord please help me overcome my temper." The only way to overcome is to through the overcoming life of Christ in one's spirit.

To be an overcomer is a matter of one's daily, normal living, not the accomplishment of any particular outward milestones. These life practices include:

1. Consecrating oneself each morning (Phil. 3:13-14)
2. Spending time with the Lord privately every day (Matt. 14:22-23; 6:6)
3. Enjoy the Lord in the Word ever day early in the morning (Psa. 119:147-148)
4. Deal with sins thoroughly (1 John 1:7, 9)
5. Maintain fellowship with the Lord moment by moment by living a life of prayer (2 Cor. 13:14; Phil. 4:6-7)
6. Redeem the time, spending energy to be soaked with God's Word (2 Tim. 3:16-17; Col. 3:16)
7. Rejoicing always, praying unceasingly giving thanks in everything (Eph. 5:18; 1 Thes. 5:16-19)
8. Be dominated, governed, directed, moved and lead by the Spirit (2 Cor. 2:13)
9. Live in the presence of Christ (2 Cor. 2:10; 4:6-7)
10. Receive Christ as grace (2 Cor. 12:7-10; 13:14)
