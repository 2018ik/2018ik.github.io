## Background

## Grace = Christ as enjoyment

1. The ancient Greeks viewed grace (*χάρις*) as something which brings joy, being closely related to *χαίρω* which means "to rejoice."
2. Grace in a theological sense came through Jesus Christ (John 1:17). 
   1. Grace "came" while the law was "given" indicating that grace is a Person
   2. There was plenty of unmerited favor and material blessings of God before Jesus Christ. Thus, grace is something more than unmerited favor.
3. Grace is with the spirit (Gal. 6:18), indicating that it is something inward, not outward
4. It was not Paul who labored, but grace (1 Cor. 15:10)
5. "Not I, but the grace of God" in 1 Cor. 15:10 corresponds to "not I, but Christ" in Gal. 2:20, indicating that grace is Christ
6. Grace as the person of Christ empowers Paul in his spirit to enjoy God

## Spirit = Grace

1. 
As grace came through Christ so did the Spirit (John 1:17; John 16:13). The all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit was "not yet" prior to Christ's resurrection (John 7:39) and breathed into the disciples post-resurrection (John 20:22). Furthermore, there is a principle in the Bible where all that the Father has is embodied in the Son and all that the Son has is realized as the Spirit. Therefore, as there is the "grace of Christ" so is there the "Spirit of Christ." Therefore, the Spirit which is the ultimate realization of Christ is grace and is the only way for us to experience grace.
