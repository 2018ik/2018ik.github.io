## Background

**Religion** in the Bible is worship of any kind - be it sound, scriptural or fundamental - without the presence of Christ. This is depicted by idolatry in the Old Testament and the Pharisees/Sadducees/Judiazers/etc. in the New Testament, and is a veil and negative force which distracts from Christ Himself. Although the typical definition of religion is any kind of belief in a high power, in the Bible, to be religious is to be without Christ. The Bible reveals that Christ is everything (Phil. 1:21; Phil. 2:21), while the outward practices, rituals and doctrines of religion are nothing. Religion seeks to change a person outwardly; God's economy is to change a person inwardly to be the same as God in life and nature.

## Biblical Basis

### Pharisees

### Paul

In Galatians 1:14, Paul says that he had advanced in Judaism beyond his contemporaries, but he had realized that was not what pleased God. What pleases God is for Him to reveal His Son in His chosen people (Gal. 1:16). To advance in Judaism, that is to advance in religion, in this case was to distract from the reality that is Christ which is the only thing that pleases God.

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>Once I was in Vatican city and I saw a person going up the stairs on his knees. Step by step on his knees in tears in front of so many people without shame. I asked what that was about and they said he was paying penance for a terrible sin. I was sure that he was deeply convicted by this sin, and it pained his conscience, so to gain relief, he hoped to gain God's acceptance by doing this. But this is altogether through man's work. Jesus has shed His blood for us. We need to believe in the efficacy of His blood! But instead, this man believed in his knees and his self-effort to please God. This is what Paul was calling the Galatians foolish for - he called them foolish for trying to elevate the law and nullify the grace of God!
