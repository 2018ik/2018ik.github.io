## Background

Religion is a veil, and a negative force which distracts from Christ Himself. The typical definition of religion is any kind of metaphysical belief especially of a high power, but in the Bible, it can be seen that Christ is everything (Phil. 1:21; Phil. 2:21), while the outward practices, rituals and doctrines of religion are nothing.

## Biblical Basis

### Pharisees

### Paul

In Galatians 1:14, Paul says that he had advanced in Judaism beyond his contemporaries, but he had realized that was not what pleased God. What pleases God is for Him to reveal His Son in His chosen people (Gal. 1:16). To advance in Judaism, that is to advance in religion, in this case was to distract from the reality that is Christ which is the only thing that pleases God.
