## Background

The divine **essence** (Greek: *ousia*, Latin: *essentia* or *substantia*) is the indivisible substance which holds the Three of the divine Trinity together as One; God is one because there is only one essence in God. As there is only one essence, it is not distributed among the three as parts, but simultaneously exists wholly in the three through coinherence. This is what the Father has that the Son also has that the Spirit also has (John 16:13-15). Because the divine essence in its entirety is within each of the Three, each hypostasis is the complete God (Col. 2:9)

The Bible does not speak directly of the divine essence, but it is implied: anything with the divine nature has the divine essence. A substance will always have its own physical and chemical properties; likewise, an essence has an outward manifestation in its nature. For example, God is Spirit (John 4:24), love (1 John 4:8) and light (1 John 1:15), these are the nature of God. There is one divine nature held entirely by the Father, Son, and Spirit. However with respect to this nature's relationship with man, the Father is the origin, the Son is the expression and the Spirit is the transmission.

The closest word to essence in the Bible is the word for Godhead in Colossians 2:9, which is what makes God, God. 

This essence is not judicial but organic. As the intrinsic relationship between Father and Son is not authority but life, so is the relationship between the Three of the Trinity is the divine life.
