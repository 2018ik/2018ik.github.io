## Background

A **stewardship** is the service in which one takes care of a household's needs by means of a dispensation of resources. Historically, a steward would serve the royal family to take care of arrangements such as food. As stewards of God, a believers' stewardship is to distribute and dispense the riches of God into others. 

This is the same Greek word as economy. While God's plan in His economy, the carrying out of God's plan through man is his stewardship (1 Cor. 4:1-2).
