## Background

In Matthew 22, the Lord Jesus was tested by the Pharisees with the Herodians, the Sadducees and a lawyer of the Pharisees.

## Tests

### Tribute to Caesar

(Matt. 22:15-22)

The Pharisees, fundamentalists of Judaism, asked Jesus whether it was lawful to give tribute to Caesar while the Herodians, the political party under King Herod was present. If Jesus answered yes, it would offend the Jews, if He answered no, it would offend the Romans. 

Instead of answering in this way, He asked them to show Him a coin for the tribute, and said to render the things of Caesar to Caesar and the things of God to God.

### Resurrection Edge-case

(Matt. 22:23-33)

The Sadducees asked what would happen to a wife who had multiple husbands during the resurrection. The twofold answer is that in resurrection there is no marriage, and that resurrection must exist as God is not a God of the dead, but of the living. 

### Greatest Law

(Matt. 22:34-40)

### Uno Reverse Card

(Matt. 22:41-46)
