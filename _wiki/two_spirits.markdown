## Background

There are two spirits mentioned in the New Testament, and the essence of the New Testament is the two spirits - the divine Spirit and the human spirit. 

## Biblical Basis

Three verses in particular mention both of these spirits in the same verse: John 3:6, John 4:24 and Romans 8:16.

In John 3:6 - "...that which is born of the Spirit is spirit" - reveals divinity entering into humanity to conceive in us a new life essence. 

In John 4:24 - "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in Spirit and truthfulness" - shows that the Spirit is able to elicit adoration and approach from us.

In Romans 8:16 - "The Spirit Himself witnesses with out spirit that we are children of God." - the leading one (the Spirit) is waiting for us to initiate whatever we want to do in the fellowship which ocurred in the our worship.
