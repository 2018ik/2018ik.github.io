## Background

**Another angel** as referenced in Revelation 7:2, 8:3, 10:1 and 18:1 refers to Christ. Another angel implies that this is not a common angel but a special one. As another angel, Christ cares for God's chosen people (Rev. 7:3), receives and executes the prayers of the saints (Rev. 8:3-5), possess the earth (Rev. 10:1-5) and come down in glory to make the whole earth God's kingdom (Rev. 18:1; 11:15).

The picture of the saints' prayers in Revelation 8:3-5 shows that when prayers are delivered to Christ, they are added with Christ as the incense, and then burnt and scattered to the earth. The entire earth is under the divinely burnt answers of the saints' prayers.

In the Old Testament, Christ was also called the Angel of Jehovah (Gen. 22:11-12).
