## Background

**Another angel** as referenced in Revelation 7:2, 8:3, 10:1 and 18:1 refers to Christ. Another angel implies that this is not a common angel but a special one. As another angel, Christ cares for God's chosen people (Rev. 7:3), receives and executes the prayers of the saints (Rev. 8:3-5), possess the earth (Rev. 10:1-5) and come down in glory to make the whole earth God's kingdom (Rev. 18:1; 11:15).

In chapter 8 verses 3-5, there is a very interesting illustration on how prayer works. The prayers of the saints are delivered to the golden altar before the throne, and this is offered along with incense. Incense here typifies Christ, who is added to the prayers of men. The incense is then burnt and the smoke goes up to the Father. This ascending of the smoke shows that the prayers of the saints are acceptable to God and have become effective. Then, the fire of the altar is cast to the earth, which causes natural disasters to occur. The entire earth is actually under the answers of the saint's prayers (which in this case appears to be for the execution of God's judgement).

In the Old Testament, Christ was also called the Angel of Jehovah (Gen. 22:11-12).
