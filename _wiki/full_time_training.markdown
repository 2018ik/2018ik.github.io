>"Buy truth and do not sell it"

\- Prov. 23:23

## Background

The FTTA's primary goal is to help the trainees know the truth throughout its two-year curriculum. To buy truth (Prov. 23:23) we must redeem the time, as well as our being. We "redeem" our being by opening our being, that is through consecration. 

Today, God wants to dwell in our midsts, but there is a massive disparity being us and Him. We need to learn how to live with Him, how to match Him. This is also a training on how to spend time with the Lord.

The study of the truth in the FTTA constitutes the trainees with a healthy deposit and an enlarged appetite for the truth that will result in a lifetime endeavor of studying the truth (2 Tim. 1:13-14)

## Unique Atmosphere

The FTTA has a unique atmosphere with an environment most conducive to studying the truth. It is a separated and sanctified place, which takes the way of the proper teaching. There is also a community of consecrated ones (your peers) to pursue with. 

This is an extended period of time without social media bombardment, endless scrolling and content consumption, and where one can learn to come to the mountain to behold God to eat and to drink.

## Classes

### The Full Ministry of Christ

### The Triune God and His Word

This is the foundational class of the full-time training. Much like how eating, drinking and breathing are foundational to physically living, this class is foundational and will impact every other class we have in the training.

If we don't have a good grasp of the revelation concerning the Triune God, our concept regarding the New Jerusalem will be warped. Likewise, if we don't have a good basis in the Word, it's impossible for us to grasp the revelation it contains.
