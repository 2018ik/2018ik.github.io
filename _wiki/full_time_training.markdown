>"Buy truth and do not sell it"

\- Prov. 23:23

## Background

The FTTA's primary goal is to help the trainees know the truth throughout its two-year curriculum. To buy truth (Prov. 23:23) we must redeem the time, as well as our being. We "redeem" our being by opening our being, that is through consecration. 

Today, God wants to dwell in our midsts, but there is a massive disparity being us and Him. We need to learn how to live with Him, how to match Him. This is also a training on how to spend time with the Lord.

The study of the truth in the FTTA constitutes the trainees with a healthy deposit and an enlarged appetite for the truth that will result in a lifetime endeavor of studying the truth (2 Tim. 1:13-14)

When the Lord called the children of Israel out of Egypt, the Lord stopped them in the wilderness and had a training with them. He taught them who He was and how they should live with the intention that through this training and instruction they would be a people corporately who would express God. All the other nations on earth expressed something of man, but there was no nation that was corporately expressing God, which was God's original intention. 

## Unique Atmosphere

The FTTA has a unique atmosphere with an environment most conducive to studying the truth. It is a separated and sanctified place, which takes the way of the proper teaching. There is also a community of consecrated ones (your peers) to pursue with. 

This is an extended period of time without social media bombardment, endless scrolling and content consumption, and where one can learn to come to the mountain to behold God to eat and to drink.

## Classes

### The Full Ministry of Christ

### The Triune God and His Word

This is the foundational class of the full-time training. Much like how eating, drinking and breathing are foundational to physically living, this class is foundational and will impact every other class we have in the training.

If we don't have a good basis in the Word, it's impossible for us to grasp the revelation it contains.
Likewise, of we don't have a good grasp of the revelation concerning the Triune God, our concept regarding the New Jerusalem will be warped.

### Spirit

If you went to a seminary or Bible school, there would be no class devoted to the Spirit from the perspective we have here, versus something like pneumatology. The Spirit is the reaching between God and man, and we need to know the Spirit in our spirit to experience the Spirit as it is in the spirit that we have all the elements of divinity and the uplifted humanity of Jesus. 

### Experience of Christ as Life

This is perhaps the most fundamental and basic class in the FTTA. However, often the most superficially basic things actually go very deep; after all, Christ Himself is very deep and bottomless.

While it's important to learn the basic matters such as our human Spirit is the divine resonance, this basic matter also opens into something much more than just that.

Suppose you are a basketball player, a game which requires basic skills. Once you know the basics, you can play the game. In this class, it's not that you learn the basics to play the game - when you learn the basics you *are* playing the game. By learning about how to experience Christ as life, you actually experience Christ as life.

We have the books *The Experience of Life* and *The Experience of Christ*, but these may imply that were are experiencing the life of Christ. Instead we have the experience of Christ as life. In this class, we experience the person directly, as the high priests did in the Holy of Holies. And as we go into His person directly, the experience we have supersedes and is higher than when are looking for food, light, life or a particular element. Now we want Him, and if we have Him, we have all the contents included in Him.

### Lessons on Children, Young People, and Campus Work

In the Bible there are 3 lines: the central line (fundamental tenets of the faith - Word of God, Divine Trinity, Christ, Spirit, etc.), supplemental line (potential points of disagreement - prophecies, types, the church, eschatology) and a third line of leaves and branches (practical procedures to carry out the former two). In order for a tree to exist, it needs the trunk which supplies all the leaves and branches; however the leaves and branches are what bear fruit. This lesson is part of the leaves and branches, and covers practical matters in raising up the next generation.

## Gospel Team

### Team-only Fellowship

The goal of team-only fellowship is to enter into the practical experience of a vital group. Recall a vital group's nature is spirit; we must exercise our spirit to enjoy and contact the Lord. We're developing a habit of learning to open and fellowship with one another during this time. Don't withhold your portion of Christ.

We also need to learn how to receive; if others open and there is not the proper response, it will discourage opening. Create the atmosphere where anyone can open and contribute their portion of Christ.

## Meetings

When going to the meetings, you should not act any differently than a normal saint from that locality. Don't elevate or degrade yourself, don't wear your FTTA badge. 

It is good to go early to meet some saints and to fellowship with them. Also it is good to linger a while and get to know the saints. This is very helpful for you and very enjoyable for the saints. Every church that you will go to is very happy to have the trainees visit them because you bring in a certain vitality to the meetings. So they're interested to have you, they're interested to care for you they're interested to keep you. They will enjoy fellowshipping with you but it would be sad if we went and we just isolated ourselves or we didn't make ourselves available to the saints. Also even though they appreciate you as a factor of vitality in the meetings we don't want to be over-functioning a bit too much in the prophesying meeting, let the other saints prophesy, in the prayer meeting, let the other saints pray. We just enter in the same way as they and we give ground to them but don't try to show how full of content you are or how full of life you are just function in a normal way and they will realize what you have. Then wherever you go its good to not go to be served but to serve but to volunteer to participate in service you know strictly in the homes it's good if you stay after the group meeting in that home and ask can I help clean up in any way or putting things back where they go whatever is needed just make yourself available and that also will make an impression on them. Also in the church meetings you know there are ways the trainees can serve just ask someone after the meeting and you will get to know some of the saints there.

When you serve in that kind of way, doing something practical, that will supply you also. You will feel not like a visitor but like you are one of the saints and you are entering in bearing the burden with them and they will appreciate you for that. I think the other brothers will have some more points and they'll take it from here.

There are some young people who are left with a positive impression by the trainees and I can testify that I'm one of those young people growing up in the church in LA we would have the USC team come tuesdays, wednesdays fridays and lord's days and I don't remember anything they said but I remember their person. I remember their actions, behaviors, conduct among the saints, their exercise, I even remember one brother who I could tell he was a dispositionally awkward but he made the effort to speak with me and I really appreciated that. That doesn't mean we need to be super outgoing and charming but just our effort to deny ourselves and present our bodies that will lead to a very positive impression among all the saints and especially our young people so I just amen and echo Doug's fellowship.

## Testimonies

### Testimony #2

> When I was in graduate school, a brother I knew was driving through the city, and he called me to go to the park to eat hamburgers. He said, "I heard you were going to the FTTA." I said, "yes." He warned me about two temptations that would come up in my last semester in college to try and derail my intentions to go the training. And he was right, both of those things came up. But the Lord used his word and his prayer to keep me on track to come to the training. I'm sure many of you can testify the same thing. We made it here because of the shepherding of the saints. We are here not as individuals, but as members of the Body who have received the care of the Body. Of course we also need to thank the Lord for all the persons, matters and things that he has sovereignly arranged in our environment that caused us to realize we need to be trained. You may call them failures, I call them God's sovereign arrangement.

>And we also realize that many sacrifices that were made for you to be here and many practical arrangements had to be made, many of you gave up promising jobs, careers, grad school opportunities. Also I realize that some of you suffered opposition from family, from friends, from religious persons because of your decision to be here. And I know when I decided to come to the training ones who I didn't even realized cared rose up to oppose me coming to the training. And not only opposed me but opposed my family members who supported me to be here. I mention this so that you realize what a great thing it is that you've taken a stand to be in the FTTA. That stand you've taken is not a small thing, and it's not only seen by men but it's seen by the angels, the demons, spiritual forces of evil, praise the Lord we are here in the Body under the full armor of God. It's no wonder that when you make a choice to follow the Lord, it is like going across the sea in Mark 6 against the waves, against the wind. The existence of opposition testifies to us that we are on the right course.

>When I showed up for registration the first day in August, I showed up in shorts, a t-shirt and a pair of sandals. I don't know what happened to you but it couldn't be any worse. Pre-training really changed my life. You might think it's difficult but it can be a life-changing experience. The second monday night after pre-training the brothers stood up and said "and now we're going to announce the teams" and there was a rumble. I looked at the brother next to me and said, "teams? we had teams?" That tells you how much I knew about the training - I was just here to study the truth. Being on a team is a big thing in the training. So I had no idea what that was. But now having graduated and serving in the training for almost 19 years, I'm still learning what it is to be trained.
