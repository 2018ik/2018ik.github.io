>"Buy truth and do not sell it"

\- Prov. 23:23

## Background

The **Full-time Training** is a Bible truth and church service training whose primary goal is to help its trainees know the truth throughout its two-year curriculum. To buy truth (Prov. 23:23) we must redeem the time, as well as our being. We "redeem" our being by opening our being, that is through consecration. 

Today, God wants to dwell in our midsts, but there is a massive disparity being us and Him. We need to learn how to live with Him, how to match Him. This is also a training on how to spend time with the Lord. The study of the truth in the FTTA constitutes the trainees with a healthy deposit and an enlarged appetite for the truth that will result in a lifetime endeavor of studying the truth (2 Tim. 1:13-14)

When the Lord called the children of Israel out of Egypt, the Lord stopped them in the wilderness and had a training with them. He taught them who He was and how they should live with the intention that through this training and instruction they would be a people corporately who would express God. All the other nations on earth expressed something of man, but there was no nation that was corporately expressing God, which was God's original intention. 

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

> When I was in graduate school, a brother I knew was driving through the city, and he called me to go to the park to eat hamburgers. He said, "I heard you were going to the FTTA." I said, "yes." He warned me about two temptations that would come up in my last semester in college to try and derail my intentions to go the training. And he was right, both of those things came up. But the Lord used his word and his prayer to keep me on track to come to the training. I'm sure many of you can testify the same thing. We made it here because of the shepherding of the saints. We are here not as individuals, but as members of the Body who have received the care of the Body. Of course we also need to thank the Lord for all the persons, matters and things that he has sovereignly arranged in our environment that caused us to realize we need to be trained. You may call them failures, I call them God's sovereign arrangement.

>And we also realize that many sacrifices that were made for you to be here and many practical arrangements had to be made, many of you gave up promising jobs, careers, grad school opportunities. Also I realize that some of you suffered opposition from family, from friends, from religious persons because of your decision to be here. And I know when I decided to come to the training ones who I didn't even realized cared rose up to oppose me coming to the training. And not only opposed me but opposed my family members who supported me to be here. I mention this so that you realize what a great thing it is that you've taken a stand to be in the FTTA. That stand you've taken is not a small thing, and it's not only seen by men but it's seen by the angels, the demons, spiritual forces of evil, praise the Lord we are here in the Body under the full armor of God. It's no wonder that when you make a choice to follow the Lord, it is like going across the sea in Mark 6 against the waves, against the wind. The existence of opposition testifies to us that we are on the right course. 

### Testimony #2

>There are many young people who are left with a positive impression by the trainees and I can testify that I'm one of those young people growing up in the church in LA we would have the USC team come Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays and I don't remember anything they said but I remember their person. I remember their actions, behaviors, conduct among the saints, their exercise, I even remember one brother who I could tell he was a dispositionally awkward but he made the effort to speak with me and I really appreciated that. That doesn't mean we need to be super outgoing and charming but just our effort to deny ourselves and present our bodies that will lead to a very positive impression among all the saints and especially our young people.
