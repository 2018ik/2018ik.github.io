## Background

The **allotted portion** refers to the lot of inheritance that the children of Israel received of the good land of Canaan in the Old Testament (Josh. 14:1), and Christ as the preeminent and all-inclusive One to experience and enjoy in the New Testament (Col. 2:6-7; Gal. 3:14). The Spirit as this portion is the source of bountiful supply.
