## Background

The **upper room** in Acts 1 where 120 continued steadfastly to pray was a turning time which issued in the church. The Lord's move was with the small number of people praying the upper room, not with the masses without. These are those whose eyes had been opened and whose hearts were touched. 

The Lord appeared to 500 brothers after His resurrection (1 Cor. 15:6). Yet, there were only 120 in the upper room. Where did the other 380 go? Even though they saw, they had no consecration, and missed the Lord's move. It is always a small number who turn the world and the age.
