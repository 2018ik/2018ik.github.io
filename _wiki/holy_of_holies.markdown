## Background

The **Holy of Holies** is the innermost part of the tabernacle and is divided by a veil from the Holy Place and typifies many things:

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| God | The holiest one is God, so the Holy of Holies must signify God Himself. |
| The human spirit | The tabernacle typifies tripartite man with the innermost part being the human spirit. |
| The church | The reality of the church is the spirit of all the believers. |
| New Jerusalem | The New Jerusalem is a cube, just like the Holy of Holies. |

To come forward to the Holy of Holies is to turn one's heart to the spirit, where there is God Himself (Heb. 10:19-22; 4:16)
