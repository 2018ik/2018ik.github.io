## Human Perspective

In the church life, there will inevitably be offenses. We must learn to forgive. The Lord's heart is for us to forgive.

> Then Peter came and said to Him, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Up to seven times? 
>Jesus said to him, I do not say to you, Up to seven times, but, Up to seventy times seven.

\- Matt. 18:21-22
