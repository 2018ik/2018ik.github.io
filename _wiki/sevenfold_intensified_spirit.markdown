## Background

The **Sevenfold Intensified Spirit** seen in Revelation 1:4 is for the completion of the age and consummating God's purpose. The Spirit had to be intensified sevenfold to deal with the degradation of the churches seen in Revelation chapters 2 and 3, and to produce the overcomers to build the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem.

## Biblical Basis

In Revelation 1:4-5, the ordering of the Trinity is the Father, seven Spirits, and Son rather than the Father, Son, and Spirit seen in Matthew 28. The emphasis on the seven Spirits here in revelation is it is needed for the closing of the age. Seven signifies completion, as seen in the seven seals, seven trumpets, seven bowls, seven days, and seven years.
