## Background

The **Sabbath** is a day of rest on the seventh day when God rested after creating man on the sixth day (Exo. 31:17). He rested because He had finished His work: His glory was manifested because man had His image, and His authority with His dominion was about to be exercised to subdue the enemy (Gen. 1:26). The children of Israel observe this day as a perpetual covenant, a sign between God and His people that they might know the God who sanctifies them (Exo. 31:12-17). 

## Significance

On God's side, the sabbath rest is satisfaction in His hearts desire. If there is a situation on earth in which man expressed God, that situation is a rest to Him (Heb. 2:6-8). On man's side, the Sabbath signifies that God has done everything, prepared everything and that man must stop all his work. This is not an outward matter, but to take Christ as one's rest (Heb. 4:9). For God in creation, it was a matter of working then resting. For the regenerated believers, it is a matter of resting in Christ, then working together with Christ. God must be firstly enjoyed as rest for a proper work to be carried out.

There are three stages of experiencing Christ as rest.

1. Age of grace: rest is experienced in the mingled spirit
2. Millennial kingdom: overcoming saints are co-kings wit Christ and enjoy the rest in a fuller way
3. Eternity future: new heaven and new earth; all are made subject to God (1 Cor. 15:24-27) and the rest will be enjoyed in the fullest way for all eternity
