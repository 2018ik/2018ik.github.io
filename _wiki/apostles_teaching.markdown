>"Everyone who goes beyond and does not abide in the teaching of Christ does not have God; he who abides in the teaching, he has both the Father and the Son. If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, rejoice!"

\- 1 John 9-10

## Background

The apostles' teaching is simply the teaching of God's eternal economy. There are so many teachings - head covering, washing our feet, baptism by immersion - these are good, but it is not **the** teaching. There is only one apostles' teaching, and this is the one teaching revealed and recognized by God in the New Testament.

This teaching is like the constitution of the Church. It is the "law of the land." It is of utmost importance that we follow the apostles' teaching, and teach the apostles' teaching. Teaching the same thing is the holding factor for the one accord, and keeps us in oneness for the one goal. 

## History

### Matthew 28:20

This teaching is related to Matthew 28:20 when the Lord told the disciples to teach all the things which He had taught. 

### Acts 1:1-3

After Jesus had resurrected, He presented Himself and appeared to the disciples through a period of forty days, speaking things concerning the kingdom of God.

### Acts 2:41-42

The church then began to meet house to house in Acts 2:41-42 teaching and fellowshipping regarding the apostles' teaching. The teaching here is related directly to God's economy for the keeping of the oneness of the Church, the Body of Christ.

## Principle of Incarnation

The apostles' teaching is God speaking in the Son to His New Testament people. This principle states that God speaks through man, and that Jesus was the first man through whom He spoke. This is in contrast with the Old Testament age where God spoke though many prophets.

Then, God spoke in the Son as the Spirit through the apostles. 

## Divine Constitution

This constitution must be held by the Church absolutely. The apostles' teaching should be universally taught everywhere in every church in the same way (1 Cor. 4:17; 7:17). 

No other belief besides the unique faith was allowed by the apostles (Gal. 1:7-9).

## Love

We should be governed by love in our teaching and meeting. This is the only way to abide by the apostles' teaching.


## Words of Warning

- Never forget about the apostles' teaching
- Never think that you already know everything about the apostles' teaching.
- Never insist or resist any practice. Pray about it.
