>"Everyone who goes beyond and does not abide in the teaching of Christ does not have God; he who abides in the teaching, he has both the Father and the Son. If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, rejoice!"

\- 1 John 9-10

## Background

The **apostles' teaching** is the entire speaking of God in the New Testament, and simply the teaching of God's eternal economy concerning the full ministry of Christ. There are so many teachings - head covering, washing our feet, baptism by immersion - these are good, but it is not **the** teaching. Furthermore, a teaching that emphasizes any one of those aforementioned practices will cause division. There is only one apostles' teaching, and this is the one teaching revealed and recognized by God in the New Testament.

To be specific, the apostle's teaching concerns Christ's person and redemptive work (2 John 9-11) and God's economy in faith (1 Tim. 1:3-4). This includes the full ministry of Christ in three stages, as well as other matters of the central line.

## History 

### Matthew 28:20

The Lord tells the disciples to teach all the things which He had taught. This is the apostle's teaching and the only real teaching revealed by the Bible.

### John 7:16-17

The Lord reveals that His teaching is not His own, but the Father's. The teaching was not even the Son's, but the one who sent Him. This makes it clear that the source of teaching is God the Father, not any human being.

### John 16:13-14

When the Sprit of reality comes, the Spirit will also not speak from Himself, but what He hears from the Son.

### Acts 1:1-3

After Jesus had resurrected, He presented Himself and appeared to the disciples through a period of forty days, speaking things concerning the kingdom of God.

### Acts 2:41-42

The church then began to meet house to house in Acts 2:41-42 continuing steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles. The teaching here is related directly to God's economy for the keeping of the oneness of the Church, the Body of Christ.

### 1 Cor 2:12-13

We have confidence in the apostle's teaching because it's sourced in the Spirit, whose words are sourced from the Son, whose words are sourced from the Father. The words we hear today can only be trusted if it is sourced from the Spirit, as opposed to human wisdom.

### 2 Tim something

When Paul commissioned Timothy in his last epistle, he told him to "Fulfill your ministry." Paul is able to say this, rather than "fulfill *my* ministry" is because their ministries are one and the same, governed by the Apostle's teaching.

## Divine Constitution

The apostles' teaching should be universally taught everywhere in every church in the same way (1 Cor. 4:17; 7:17). This teaching is like the constitution of the Church. It is the "law of the land." Teaching the same thing is the holding factor for the one accord, and keeps us in oneness for the one goal. No other belief besides the unique faith was allowed by the apostles (Gal. 1:7-9).

When there is no restriction and limitation to the extent of what is taught in the church, it will generate division. This is why Paul emphatically said to not teach different things which are not according to God's economy and the gospel of Christ (1 Tim. 1:4; Gal. 1:7-9). Christianity today has many teachings outside the limit of the apostles' teaching which causes problems, divisions and confusion. 

## Love

We should be governed by love in our teaching and meeting. This is the only way to abide by the apostles' teaching.

## Words of Warning

- Never forget about the apostles' teaching
- Never think that you already know everything about the apostles' teaching.
- Never insist or resist any practice. Pray about it.
