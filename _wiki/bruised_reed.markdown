## Background

The **bruised reed** in Matthew 12:20 refers to the reeds of flutes used by Jews in ancient times, which they would break if bruised. Some of the Lord's people are like a bruised reed, which fail to produce a musical sound. The Lord however will not break that is to cast away such people, but they will be used by God to bring forth justice unto victory.

## Significance

In the Lord's work, it is easy to consider the outward condition of the saints, and to prefer working with those of a good condition. However the Lord uses all, that He would perfect them to be useful. It is not up to man to decide who they should work with, but to God. If someone is given a "good" one to work with, so be it, likewise the "bad" ones.

Sometimes, one may personally feel like they are bruised reed, or a smoking flax. But the Lord has experienced all of these things, and will not cast us away (Heb. 4:16).
