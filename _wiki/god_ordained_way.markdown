## Background

The God-ordained way refers to begetting, nourishing, perfecting and prophesying. This is how to church life can be practiced.

Each of these four steps requires presenting the truth to others. The best way to be constituted by the truth in the experience of many is PSRP.


## Vision  

The vision of the God-ordained way is to enter into a new revival. 

## Revival

The Lord needs to revive us (Hab. 3:2) so that we can enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is (Eph. 3:9). This has been revealed to us, and now we need to have the burden to enlighten all; it is not merely an individual matter.

Revival is not just a one time thing, or a once a year thing. We need to be revived every morning during morning revival.

## Biblical Basis

The whole New Testament is about cherishing and nourishing.
