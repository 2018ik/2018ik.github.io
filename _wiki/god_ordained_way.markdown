## Background

The God-ordained way refers to the way ordained by God in order to carry out His New Testament economy. This has been condensed into the four practices of begetting, nourishing, teaching (perfecting) and prophesying. This is how to church life can be practiced according to the New Testament ministry.

Each of these four steps requires presenting the truth to others. The best way to be constituted by the truth in the experience of many is PSRP.

## Biblical Basis

Our goal is to build up the Body of Christ (Eph 4:8-16), but in order to do so, we must see how the early church portrayed in Acts did so. Actually, the whole New Testament is about cherishing and nourishing. 

## Practice

All of the below steps should be executed when one is in the [reality of the Body of Christ](../body_of_christ#reality-today), otherwise it is a mere facsimile. We need be involvement with the Lord in a full, mutual, divine and human way to fully carry out the God-ordained way. These steps should likewise be enjoyable, and occur organically, as being joined to Christ is a prerequisite to carrying out any of the below. Since this requires such a living, it is therefore something that is lived out in one's daily lives.

### Steps

#### Begetting

We need to preach the gospel to obtain the material for the building. This is to have sinners saved and regenerated to become members of Christ.

#### Nourishing

After being saved, the believers need to grow in the divine life. This could be through the home meetings and group meetings, where we lead to to function in the meetings and to care for one another.

#### Perfecting

#### Building

### Vision  

The vision of the God-ordained way is to enter into a new revival. 

### Revival

The Lord needs to revive us (Hab. 3:2) so that we can enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is (Eph. 3:9). This has been revealed to us, and now we need to have the burden to enlighten all; it is not merely an individual matter.

Revival is not just a one time thing, or a once a year thing. We need to be revived every morning during morning revival.

### God's Economy

The focus of the God-ordained way is God's economy. When we present God to others, we need to have God's economy in mind. We are just stewards in God's household cooperating with His good pleasure.

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>I really enjoyed Ephesians 1:5, which says that God predestined us to be sons through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of His will. This morning, I read Romans 8:15, which says that we have not received the spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but have received the Spirit of sonship, by whom we cry, "Abba, Father."
>
>Previously, I thought that God's economy stopped after making man God in life and nature, but not in the Godhead, which is amazing. But in my studies yesterday, I realized that we practically see this in the church meetings. It says in every church meeting, the divine Trinity operates in the Christian gathering for the purpose of carrying out the dispensing of the processed Triune God.
>
>The matter of the sonship in us becoming God's life and nature is amazing! But how do we do it? We come to the meetings, and Christ is dispensed into us. We cooperate with the Divine Trinity and Christ is in us! This is how we carry out the God-ordained way. I was just so touched by this matter.

### Testimony #2

>God has a will. So he purposed to fulfill it. He made a counsel and a plan to carry it out, because within him, within his will, there is his good pleasure. Saints, there is really something that makes God happy. You know, some may consider it a great privilege to work under the topmost constitutional scholar of the United States, but what is a greater privilege is to be chosen to be able to participate in what makes God happy. 
>
>Saints, there are so many Christians out there who want to make God happy, but they don't know how. This was me. I was told to do things for the Lord, but I never asked what was on His heart. What is in His heart is that He wants to have sons. For this reason, God became man, that man may become God in life and nature, but not in the Godhead. I am touched that God has chosen you and me in this room and touched in us something that was hidden in His heart throughout the ages, and the way we carry this out is through the God-ordained way.
