## Background

The **God-ordained way** (also known as the "new way") refers to the scriptural way ordained by God for His people to meet and serve to carry out His New Testament economy by releasing the organic functions of each member of the Body of Christ for the building up of the Body. This has been condensed into the four practices of begetting, nourishing, teaching (perfecting) and building especially in the homes. It is not enough to meet once a week in a church building; according to the revelation in Acts, believers [must meet in the homes](../home_meeting) to build up the church.

If all the church does is beget new believers, these new ones will have no way to go on. Therefore, there has to be nourishing in order to feed them. Then, they can be taught and perfected regarding the truth. Lastly, the perfecting of the new ones will allow them to build up the church through prophesying. This issues in the proper church life in which all believers are priests (1 Pet 2:9).

The God-ordained way is carried out by vital groups: groups of living and active believers who mutually fellowship and gather together to bear remaining fruit.

## Biblical Basis

The goal of the God-ordained way is to build up the Body of Christ (Eph 4:8-16). In order to do so, the way early church developed in Acts can be examined, and the way the early apostles preached can be followed as an example. The apostles did not meet and serve according to Jewish or Greek tradition, but an altogether new way revealed to them no doubt by the Holy Spirit.

## Practice

Practicing the God-ordained way is not an outward matter, actually it is a living which requires a personal and affectionate relationship with God. The below steps should be executed with a view of God's economy and in newness of life, otherwise it is a mere facsimile and a movement. One needs be involved with the Lord in a full, mutual, divine and human way to fully carry out the God-ordained way. Therefore, practically speaking, the most important work in the God-ordained way is prayer.

Generally speaking however, for each step one must first see the vision, so their work is backed by a divine commission. Then, they must pray, followed by labor. This is a patient, persistent and faithful work to preach the gospel and to bear lasting fruit. Much like a farmer, one must appreciate the fruits of their labor and care for their fields to yield a consistent harvest. Lastly, one must study their results, and study the truth. 

### Steps

#### Begetting

The first step is to preach the gospel as New Testament priests (Rom. 15:16) to obtain the material for the building. This is to have sinners saved and regenerated to become members of the Body of Christ. 

#### Nourishing

After being saved, the believers need to grow in the divine life. After a new child is born, they must be nourished; this is to feed the lambs (John 21:15). This could be through the home meetings and group meetings, where we lead to to function in the meetings and to care for one another.

#### Perfecting

Perfecting is to allow the new believers to build up the Body of Christ. The primary role of the gifted ones is to perfect the saints for the building (Eph. 4:11-12).

#### Building

To build up the church is to speak for God. This is revealed clearly in 1 Corinthians 14. When the believers come together and enter into their function, especially in the matter of prophesying, the church is built up (1 Cor. 14:26). 

## Opposition

There are many even among Christians who do not condone gospel preaching, as well as the principle of each one prophesying i.e. speaking for God. This argument is that those who are not theologically educated cannot speak the proper words. 

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>I really enjoyed Ephesians 1:5, which says that God predestined us to be sons through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of His will. This morning, I read Romans 8:15, which says that we have not received the spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but have received the Spirit of sonship, by whom we cry, "Abba, Father."
>
>Previously, I thought that God's economy stopped after making man God in life and nature, but not in the Godhead, which is amazing. But in my studies yesterday, I realized that we practically see this in the church meetings. It says in every church meeting, the divine Trinity operates in the Christian gathering for the purpose of carrying out the dispensing of the processed Triune God.
>
>The matter of the sonship in us becoming God's life and nature is amazing! But how do we do it? We come to the meetings, and Christ is dispensed into us. We cooperate with the Divine Trinity and Christ is in us! This is how we carry out the God-ordained way. I was just so touched by this matter.

### Testimony #2

>God has a will. So he purposed to fulfill it. He made a counsel and a plan to carry it out, because within him, within his will, there is his good pleasure. Saints, there is really something that makes God happy. You know, some may consider it a great privilege to work under the topmost constitutional scholar of the United States, but what is a greater privilege is to be chosen to be able to participate in what makes God happy. 
>
>Saints, there are so many Christians out there who want to make God happy, but they don't know how. This was me. I was told to do things for the Lord, but I never asked what was on His heart. What is in His heart is that He wants to have sons. For this reason, God became man, that man may become God in life and nature, but not in the Godhead. I am touched that God has chosen you and me in this room and touched in us something that was hidden in His heart throughout the ages, and the way we carry this out is through the God-ordained way.
