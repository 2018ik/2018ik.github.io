## Background

**Nourishing** (along with cherishing) is the second step of the God-ordained way, and follows begetting. This is according to the Biblical principle of bearing remaining fruit.

The primary goal in nourishing the newly baptized ones is to help them to have a personal contact with the Lord by their spirit directly. During this time, they should learn about the crucial practices of the Christian life, such as reading the Bible, praying, having morning revival, and attending the meetings. The focus should be on feeding, not on correction. The words which we speak should be according to their personal need (Eph. 4:29).

## Biblical Basis

In John 21:15, the Lord charges Peter to feed His lambs. These lambs are already in the Lord's flock, but they need to continually grow through feeding. In his epistle to the Thessalonians, Paul says that he was gentle in their midst, as a nursing mother would cherish her own children (1 Thes. 2:7). After a new one is saved and baptized, they must continue to be nourished and cherished.

## Principles

### Feeding

Children should be nourished with milk and baby food, not complicated topics and long Bible reading sessions (1 Pet. 2:2). Regardless of one's worldly position and maturity, they are a spiritual babe, and thus must be fed with the proper food.  For example, singing easily turns to calling, which easily turns to praying the stanzas, which easily turns to pray reading the word. Recall the goal is not to teach doctrine, but to get them to exercise their spirit.

Furthermore, it is possible to overfeed. A newborn can only eat so much, so to force-feeding them excess spiritual food will result it none of the food staying in, as well as causing them to question whether or not its worth coming back to you for food. Bringing a person into the vast mystery of God's economy should be a very gradual process. Each appointment and meeting should only introduce a few items, and through this gradual feeding and digestion a new one can properly grow.

### Love

Love is the most excellent way (1 Cor. 12:31) and in nourishing, all new ones should be loved indiscriminately. A genuine love sourced from God spontaneously cherishes. The church is not a police station for arresting or a law court for judging (Matt. 9:10; John 8:10-11); it is a home to raise up the believers (1 Thes. 2:11), a hospital to heal and to recover (Luke 10:33-35), and a school to teach (1 Cor. 4:17). As one loves and appreciates the Lord, they also must love and appreciate the new ones.
