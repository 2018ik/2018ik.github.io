## Background

**Nourishing** (and cherishing) is the second step of the God-ordained way, and follows begetting. This is according to the Biblical principle of bearing remaining fruit.

Nourishing the new believers involves educating them spiritually with the loving care of God. During this time, they should learn about the crucial practices of the Christian life, such as reading the Bible, praying, having morning revival, and attending the meetings. During this time, the focus should be on feeding, not on correction.

## Biblical Basis

In John 21:15, the Lord charges Peter to feed His lambs. These lambs are already in the Lord's flock, but they need to continually grow through feeding. In his epistle to the Thessalonians, Paul says that he was gentle in their midst, as a nursing mother would cherish her own children (1 Thes. 2:7). After a new one is saved and baptized, they must continue to be nourished and cherished.

## Aspects

### Milk

Children should be nourished with milk, and not complicated topics and even long Bible reading sessions. 

### Singing

Singing easily turns to calling, which easily turns to praying the stanzas, which easily turns to pray reading the word. The goal is not to teach the new ones doctrine, but to get them to exercise their spirit.
