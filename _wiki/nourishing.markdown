## Background

**Nourishing** (and cherishing) is the second step of the God-ordained way, and follows begetting. This is according to the Biblical principle of bearing remaining fruit.

Nourishing the new believers involves educating them spiritually with the loving care of God.

## Biblical Basis

In John 21:15, the Lord charges Peter to feed His lambs. These lambs are already in the Lord's flock, but they need to continually grow through feeding. In his epistle to the Thessalonians, Paul says that he was gentle in their midst, as a nursing mother would cherish her own children (1 Thes. 2:7). After a new one is saved and baptized, they must continue to be nourished and cherished.
