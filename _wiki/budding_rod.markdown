## Background

The budding rod of Aaron signifies the resurrection life of Christ (Num. 17:8). Since the resurrected, budded rod was the one chosen by God, resurrection is the basis of God's selection and should be the basis of our service (Num. 17:9-10). On the other hand, what we can do out of our self belongs to the natural realm. Man must come to the end of himself before he will be convinced of his utter uselessness (Matt. 19:26). At this point, we can experience Christ as te resurrection life.
