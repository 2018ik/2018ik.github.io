## Background

The **pledging** of the Holy Spirit is a guarantee of the regenerated believers' divine inheritance for their experience and enjoyment in the present age (Eph. 1:14). According to 2 Corinthians 1:22, the sealing of the Spirit issues in the pledging. 

## Etymology

The Greek word used for "pledge" (arrabon) is a down payment when making a large purchase. To secure a deal and to show commitment, a portion of the total cost can be paid upfront; this is the *arrabon*. Knowing this context, some translators choose to translate this word as "foretaste." God is giving us a foretaste of the things to come, that is the full enjoyment and gaining of God.

## Application

The pledge of the Spirit is given for our present enjoyment. While the pledge is a one-time guarantee, it should be a continual encouragement to us. The continual encouragement of the one-time pledge is the *pledging* of the Spirit. When the Lord pledges the Spirit to us, the more of Him we gain. This result of this is like eating: when we eat and enjoy the Lord, our appetite enlarges and we eat and enjoy the Lord even more.
