## Background

These are **important verses** which include crucial truths regarding God's NT economy.

## 1 Cor. 6:17

>But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.

Perhaps the most important verse in the Bible, this verse shows the oneness between God and man. Being one mingled spirit with God is much more than having God's mercy, God's favor or God's presence; it is to be intermingled with God as one spirit and for this spirit to become the spirit of the mind to transform our entire being so that we become God in life and nature.

In the context of the rest of 1 Corinthians, Paul was arguing that because all believers are joined to the Lord as one, for a believer to sin is to drag down the entire Body.

## 2 Cor. 13:14

>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.

Based on the context, Paul's enumeration of the Trinity here shows that God is Triune for our experience and enjoyment. The Holy Spirit is the circulation and transmission of the grace of Christ with the love of the Father. The entire church life depends upon this divine circulation.
