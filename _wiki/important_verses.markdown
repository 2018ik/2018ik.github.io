## Background

These are **important verses** which include crucial truths regarding God's NT economy.

## 1 Cor. 6:17

>But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.

Perhaps the most important verse in the Bible, this verse shows the oneness between God and man. Being one mingled spirit with God is much more than having God's mercy, God's favor or God's presence; it is to be intermingled with God as one spirit and for this spirit to become the spirit of the mind to transform our entire being so that we become God in life and nature.
