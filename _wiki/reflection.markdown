> But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.

\- 2 Cor. 3:18

## Background

Reflecting Christ means what the God sees in Christ He also sees in us. We should not see ourself; we should see Christ. It does not matter whether or not we are a Harvard graduate with infinite IQ. God's only delight is in the Son.
