## Background

**Clearance of the past** is not a practice which the Bible explicitly charges believers to do, however it can be seen in the charge to put off the old man (Eph. 4:17-24), old garments (Gen. 35:2), and is seen in the case of Zaccheus in restoring what he owed others (Luke 19:1-10). Clearance of the past is not based on outward regulation but according to the inward moving of the Spirit; it is the power of God's salvation which causes man to clear away and end his former life.

This can also be seen in the case of the Ephesians who confessed and burned their magic books (Acts 19:19) and the Thessalonians who turned to God from idols (1 Thes. 1:9). 

## Significance

Clearance of the past is the testimony of one's salvation. Furthermore, when one puts an end to their old way of living, they will gain God's presence. Putting off the old man results in being renewed and the virtues of the new man such as compassion, kindness and lowliness (Eph. 4:23-24; Col. 3:9-12).
