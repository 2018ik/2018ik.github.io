## Background

God is unsearchably rich, and we can experience Him in the present. We have to enjoy the riches, and allow the riches to constitute us. Without the riches, the things we do become traditions and merely an earthly movement. With the riches, we sense that God is very much present with us.

The real riches revealed in the New Testament do not refer to material riches. Those who are truly rich on the earth have experienced and enjoyed the riches of Christ.

## Application

In order for the Lord's Recovery to continue to go forward, there has to be the enjoyment of the riches of Christ.
