### Joy of the Faith

When new believers continue to progress in their faith, this becomes the mutual enjoyment with those who shepherd them (Phil. 1:25). Paul poured out his entire life as drink offering for the service of the believers in Philippi, yet he continues to rejoice together with them (Phil. 2:17). And in like manner, they should also rejoice (Phil. 2:18).
