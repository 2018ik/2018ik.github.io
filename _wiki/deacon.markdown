## Background

Deacons are ones who serve the church under the elders. The word deacon comes from the Greek word meaning "serving one" or "minister." These are ones with a serving spirit.

## Biblical Examples

In Acts 6:2-3, the disciples asked te church in Jerusalem to look for seven well-attested men, full of Spirit and of wisdom, to serve the church. In Romans 16:1, there is a deaconess Phoebe from the church in Cenchrea.
