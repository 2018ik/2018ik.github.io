## Background

**Reigning in life** is to conquer, subdue, and rule over Satan, the world, sin, the flesh, the self and all environmental circumstances (Rom. 8:2, 35-37) which requires being under the restriction and limitation of the divine life in the reality of God's kingdom (Matt. 8:9), and is the goal of God's complete salvation. Reigning in life begins with receiving the abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness, the latter for judicial redemption and the former for organic salvation (Rom. 5:17). In order to reign in life, one must first be under the rulership of the Spirit. The authority through which one reigns in life comes from the authority of God. 

## Biblical Basis

Romans 5:17 says that reigning in life is through Jesus Christ, and follows receiving the abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness. The gift of righteousness is for our justification unto life (Rom. 5:18-19). The justification itself is objective, but it brings us to life that grace would abound, which is altogether a subjective experience (Rom. 5:21).
