## Background

**Reigning in life** is to conquer, subdue, and rule over Satan, the world, sin, the flesh, the self and all environmental circumstances (Rom. 8:2, 35-37) which requires being under the restriction and limitation of the divine life in the reality of God's kingdom (Matt. 8:9), and is both the goal and experience of God's complete salvation. On one hand, there is clearly picture of being saved from negative things, as indicated by the meaning of the word "salvation." However, we are not only being saved from sin and death, but we are reigning over such things in Christ's life. In a sense, reigning in life is the proof of our experience of organic salvation. Everything of organic salvation covered in Romans 6 through 16 involves reigning in life.

Reigning in life begins with receiving the abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness, the latter for judicial redemption and the former for organic salvation (Rom. 5:17). In order to reign in life, one must be under the rulership of the Spirit. The authority through which one reigns in life comes from the authority of God. 

## Purpose

As Adam's descendants, we have a king (death) in us who reigns in us (Rom. 5:17). Sin, denoting the expression of this death, reigns in death (Rom. 5:21). In order to be saved from sin, death, and all the negative things which belong to sin and death, we need to reign in life. The fact that both we and death "reign" indicates that there are two "kings" in opposition within our being. God wants us to reign through life while Satan wants sin to reign through death. 

## Eternal life

Reigning in life is unto eternal life (Rom. 5:21). This is similar to the Lord's words to the woman at the well: "The water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life." Both of the words "into" and "unto" imply an aim towards a destination. The eternal life is the destination of the flowing Triune God.


## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>In the Far East, there once was a king who was assassinated in a coup d'Ã©tat staged by a rebellious subject. One of the king's princes was hidden by a nurse who cared for him. One day, the nurse told him, "You're not just a little boy growing up in a Buddhist temple. Actually, you're a prince with the blood of kingly life flowing in your veins! Do you realize that you are going to be king?" And he became king. The realization of who he was made a difference. It impacted him and changed the course of that country to a significant degree.

>We need to pray, "Lord, give me a vision that I am a crown prince who needs to be trained to be a king reigning in life today. May this knowledge fulfill my eternal destiny to reign forever and ever as part of the New Jerusalem, the holy city, a reigning city."
