## Background

**Reigning in life** is to conquer, subdue, and rule over Satan, the world, sin, the flesh, the self and all environmental circumstances (Rom. 8:2, 35-37) which requires being under the restriction and limitation of the divine life in the reality of God's kingdom (Matt. 8:9), and is both the goal and experience of God's complete salvation. On one hand, there is clearly picture of being saved from negative things, as indicated by the meaning of the word "salvation." However, we are not only being saved from sin and death, but we are reigning over such things in Christ's life. In a sense, reigning in life is the proof of our experience of organic salvation. Everything of organic salvation covered in Romans 6 through 16 involves reigning in life.

Reigning in life begins with receiving the abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness, the latter for judicial redemption and the former for organic salvation (Rom. 5:17). In order to reign in life, one must be under the rulership of the Spirit. The authority through which one reigns in life comes from the authority of God. 

## Purpose

As Adam's descendants, we have a king (death) in us who reigns in us (Rom. 5:17). Sin, denoting the expression of this death, reigns in death (Rom. 5:21). In order to be saved from sin, death, and all the negative things which belong to sin and death, we need to reign in life. The fact that both we and death "reign" indicates that there are two "kings" in opposition within our being. God wants us to reign through life while Satan wants sin to reign through death.
