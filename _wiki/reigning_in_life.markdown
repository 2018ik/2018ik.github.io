## Background

**Reigning in life** is to be under the restriction and limitation of the divine life in the realty of God's kingdom (Rom. 5:17; 5:21). In order to reign in life, one must first be under the rulership of the Spirit. The authority through which one reigns in life comes from the authority of God.
