## Background

**Self-glorification** is to seek glory from men, and is a temptation to every Christian worker. By God's grace and mercy, many Christian workers are given statuses and positions where they can glorify themselves, but it is up to the to recognize that it is all good for nothing besides death and burial. To glorify oneself is an [inquity to God's work](../iniquity_of_the_sanctuary).

## Biblical Basis

Jesus Himself had no glory from men; He suffered persecution, came from a despised region, a poor family, was unattractive, and had an ordinary job.

Paul's gospel preaching only sought to please God, and did not seek glory from men, neither with flattering speech nor to fake holiness for self-gain (1 Thes. 2:4-6).

Anyone who seeks glory from men is a follower of Satan, who himself sought his own glory (Ezek. 28:17), and tempted Jesus to seek human glory (Matt. 4:8)
Saul also set up a monument for himself, which foreshadowed his downfall (1 Sam. 15:12).
