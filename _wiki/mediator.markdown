## Background

**Mediator** in the Bible refers to someone who deals with or intervenes between two parties. In the Old Testament, Moses was the mediator between God and man with regards to the law, the old covenant (Gal 3:19). However, in the New Testament, there is no longer a need for a mediator between God and man (Gal 3:20; 1 Tim. 2:5). In fact, God Himself is the Mediator, the executor of the new and better covenant (Heb. 8:6).

Throughout church history, especially in the Catholic church, there are many mediators which prevent the functioning of all the members of the Body. Each member of the Body has a direct connection to the Head, which is Christ, who indwells them;  therefore it is altogether illogical to pray to any intermediary party.
