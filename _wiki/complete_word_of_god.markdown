## Background

The **complete word of God** is the complete divine revelation of the Bible, which was not yet revealed until Paul wrote his epistles (Col. 1:25). Although the divine revelation has been objectively revealed, it is yet to be understood by many believers. Therefore, when the gospel is spoken to believers and unbelievers alike, the word continues to be completed in them subjectively.
