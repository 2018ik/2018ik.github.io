## Background

Salvation in the Bible is twofold: on one hand, there is salvation and eternal life through faith in Christ, one the other hand, there is a further salvation (Rom. 5:10) and a greater reward (1 Cor. 3:14; 9:24) which depends on [how one runs the race](../running_the_race) (Matt. 25:30)
