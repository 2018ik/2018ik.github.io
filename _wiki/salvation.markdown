## Background

**Salvation** in the Bible is twofold: on one hand, there is an outward, immediate, judicial salvation from eternal perdition through faith in Christ, accomplished through His redemption on the cross. This is commonly called "being saved." One the other hand, there is an inward, continual, organic salvation through the life of Christ (Rom. 5:10) and a greater reward (1 Cor. 3:14; 9:24) which depends on [how one runs the race](../running_the_race). This is a salvation in life from sin and death, as well as the dispensational punishment during the millennium (Matt. 25:30).

## Judicially

Christ died a substitutionary death for all mankind, as the wages of sin is death. However, the main purpose of this death is that it would be followed by resurrection i.e. for life to be imparted. This can be seen in John 12:24 where Christ as the one grain died to release His life to produce many grains. Furthermore in John 19:34 not only blood but also water came out of the pierced side of Christ. 

The recognition of a judicial salvation is important, but it fails to take into consideration that the Triune God is an organic being. Human fathers with human sons possessing the same human breath or spirit is a shadow of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. If God simply wanted a justifying work to render mankind righteous, then the labels given to the Trinity would just be labels of distinction with little real significance.

However, the Bible recognizes that God is living and organic: in Christ was life (John 1:4) and Christ came that we may have life (John 10:10). God intends man to not only be righteous, but to have life (Rom. 1:17). This is a matter of God dispensing Himself as life into man in the process of organic salvation. 

## Organically

The Lord's salvation is also an organic salvation of life, where the Son of God comes as life to save man from both sin and death (John 11:25; 1 John 5:12). 

Ephesians 2:5 says "by grace you have been saved." This is not the unmerited favor of Christ dying on the cross for mankind. It is the salvation by Christ's life: were were dead in offenses, and made *alive* together with Christ. After being made alive, the life of Christ continues to save believers in their daily walk (Rom. 5:10). This can be called a daily salvation.
