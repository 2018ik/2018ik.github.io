## Background

Salvation in the Bible is twofold: on one hand, there is an instant, one-time, judicial salvation from eternal perdition through faith in Christ, accomplished through His redemption on the cross. One the other hand, there is a *much more*, daily, eventual salvation through the life of Christ (Rom. 5:10) and a greater reward (1 Cor. 3:14; 9:24) which depends on [how one runs the race](../running_the_race) (Matt. 25:30).

## Judicially

Christ died a substitutionary death for all mankind, as the wages of sin is death. However, the main purpose of this death is that it would be followed by resurrection. This can be seen in John 12:24 where Christ as the one grain died to release His life to produce many grains. Furthermore in John 19:34 not only blood but also water came out of the pierced side of Christ. 

## Organically

The Lord's salvation is also an organic salvation of life, where the Son of God comes as life to save man from both sin and death (John 11:25; 1 John 5:12). 

Ephesians 2:5 says "by grace you have been saved." This is not the unmerited favor of Christ dying on the cross for mankind. It is the salvation by Christ's life: were were dead in offenses, and made *alive* together with Christ. After being made alive, the life of Christ continues to save believers in their daily walk (Rom. 5:10). This can be called a daily salvation.
