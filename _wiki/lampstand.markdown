## Background

The **lampstand** first seen in Exodus 25 was a piece of golden furniture in the Holy Place of the tabernacle which had seven lamps, one proceeding from the middle and three branches on either side. The second lampstand is seen in the building of the temple in 1 Kings 7:49, followed by the third instance in the rebuilding of God's temple in Zechariah 4:2-10. In the book of Revelation, there are seven lampstands, referring to the seven local churches.

The entire Triune God is actually encompassed in the lampstand. The gold element is the Father, the shape and form of the lampstand is the Son, and the expression of the lampstand is the Spirit. The local church being a lampstand signifies the embodiment of the Triune God. Lampstands are for shining in the night, the enlighten what is dark.

## Material

The lampstand is made of pure gold, indicating divinity. The lampstands in Revelation signifying the churches being pure gold mean that each local church is identically golden.

## Trimming

The wicks in each lamp of a lampstand will get charred, and must be trimmed by the priests. This represents the cutting off of all that does not belong to God, such as the self, natural man, lost of the first love, the world, etc.
