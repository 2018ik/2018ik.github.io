## Background

The **lampstand** first seen in Exodus 25 was a piece of golden furniture in the Holy Place which had seven lamps, one proceeding from the middle and three branches on either side. 

## Significance

## Trimming

The wicks in each lamp of a lampstand will get charred, and must be trimmed by the priests. This represents the cutting off of all that does not belong to God, such as the self, natural man, lost of the first love, the world, etc.
