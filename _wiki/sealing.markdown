## Background

The **sealing** of the Holy Spirit (2 Cor. 1:22; Eph. 1:13) imparts the Spirit as life into one's being, and is an outwardly visible mark that shows that those sealed belong to God. A stamp or seal needs to have an ink element in order to be used; this means a new element is added to the believers when they are sealed, indicating regeneration. The resulting mark of the seal is something that can be seen by others. This is similar to the inscribing ink in 2 Corinthians 3:3 (TODO: how?). The sealing encompasses one's entire organic salvation, issuing in glorification, the redemption of the body (Eph. 4:30).

The sealing of the Spirit is equivalent to the anointing of the Spirit, the addition of the Holy Spirit as oil (1 John 2:27).
