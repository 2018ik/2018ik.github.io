## Background

The sealing of the Holy Spirit (2 Cor. 1:22) imparts an outwardly visible mark on those who are sealed. A stamp or seal needs to have an ink element in order to be used; this means a new element is added to the believers when they are sealed. The resulting mark of the seal is something that can be seen by others. This is the outward expression of the transforming Spirit. This is similar to the inscribing ink in 2 Corinthians 3:3.
