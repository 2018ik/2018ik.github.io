## Background

The **sealing** of the Holy Spirit (2 Cor. 1:22; Eph. 1:13) imparts the Spirit as life into one's being, and becomes an outwardly visible mark that shows that those sealed belong to God. Upon being saved, one is sealed by the Holy Spirit. Then, the Spirit moving within is a continual sealing. 

A seal is stamped onto a document to show it originated from the issuer of the seal. A seal will also bear a unique design or image. Thus the sealing of the Spirit marks us out as belonging to God and places on us an expression of God. Furthermore, a seal needs to have an ink element in order to be used; this means a new element is added to the believers when they are sealed, indicating regeneration. The resulting mark of the seal is something that can be seen by others. This is similar to the inscribing ink in 2 Corinthians 3:3 (TODO: how?).

The sealing of the Spirit is equivalent to the anointing of the Spirit, the addition of the Holy Spirit as oil (1 John 2:27).

## Ownership

When we are sealed by God, we are permanently owned by God. When a seal is placed on a document, it verifies its authenticity as long as that document exists. Therefore, the Holy Spirit cannot leave us after it is applied to us as a seal. The Arminian school of Theology would reject this and claim that the Holy Spirit can leave if He is grieved. However, once the seal is put on, it cannot be taken away no matter what one does. This objective salvation being once-for-all and eternal is a fundamental matter of the assurance of salvation.

## Image

A seal has an image, giving receivers of the seal the image of God and the expression of God. This begins objectively as a true fact that is in the Bible, but we may not feel like we have the expression of God. Although the seal is surely upon us, we do not live the life of the seal. This is because the seal is placed on the spirit, and continues into the soul. When the mind, emotion, and will are sealed the Spirit, this is the sealing of the Spirit.

## Unto Redemption

The word *unto* in Ephesians 1:14 and 4:30 means that the seal of the Spirit is with the view to or results in the redemption of the body. This is different from *until* as in the KJV which would imply the seal is not a cause of the redemption, and the redemption will eventually come regardless of the Spirit's sealing. It is the Spirit's sealing that qualifies us to have our bodies redeemed. Upon the initial sealing, we are clearly not ready to be glorified. Only when the seal continues to spread into our whole being can we be glorified. Thus, the sealing of the Spirit encompasses one's entire organic salvation.

### Testimony #1

>When we are repenting, confessing and praying in spirit, we bear the image of God. But afterwards, if someone comes up to be and begins to argue with me over teachings it becomes apparent that their mind does not bear the image of God. When they were praying, they had the image of God, but when they began to argue with me about doctrine, this image was lost. And then in the argument, they begin to get angry, and there becomes nothing of God's image in their emotion. And then they may get so angry they cut me off! They may say they will have no more fellowship with me because in their opinion, the doctrine I teach is wrong. They exercise their strong will to terminate fellowship with me. Therefore in their mind, emotion and will, the entire soul, there is no image of God. Although they have the seal of the Spirit, the sealing of the Spirit in the spirit, they do not have the sealing in the soul.
