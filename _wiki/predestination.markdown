## Background

**Predestination** is the marking out and determination of the final outcome or destiny of a certain matter or a person before the ages. God selected the believers before the foundation of the world, marking them out beforehand. Marking out is the process, whereas predestination is the purpose (Eph. 1:5, 11).
