## Background

God's good pleasure is to to make us His sons to fulfill His eternal purpose. We don't need a reason for why God decided to do this. It's His good pleasure which God purposed in Himself.

## Biblical Basis

Ephesians 1:5 says, "Predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the **good pleasure** of His will" and Ephesians 1:9 says "Making known to us the mystery of His will according to His **good pleasure**, which He purposed in Himself."
