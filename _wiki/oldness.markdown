## Background

**Oldness** is the elements of the old creation which deadens the spirit. Oldness is closely related to opinions, with the former emphasizing doctrine and biblical practice while the latter can apply to any self-imposed belief or habit which hinders our openness to God. Both have an element of stubbornness, or unwillingness to change and prevents us from seeing and speaking the New Testament revelation. 

## Early Church

### Peter

In the early church, Peter was a leading one both in the church life and the ministry. Yet, he was somewhat short, and his shortage was due to his oldness. In Acts 10, we see he was holding on to his old kind of understanding. He was born, raised up, and taught as a Jew, and held to certain Jewish principles, especially regarding eating.

Then, a voice out of heaven asked Him to slay and eat, yet he replied "By no means" and rejected the offer three times. He was very stubborn in keeping to his practice of never eating anything common or unclean (Acts 10:14). 

### Circumcision

The Jews also brought the matter of circumcision to the gentile cities (Acts 15).

### Apollos

Apollos was not up to date with God's New Testament economy, knowing only the baptism of John (Acts 18:25). Despite being adjusted by Priscilla and Aquila  (18:26), his disciples still did not hear about the Holy Spirit, as evidenced by Paul's later visit to Corinth (Acts 19:2). This shows that Apollos stuck to his old ways and was reluctant to be adjusted.
