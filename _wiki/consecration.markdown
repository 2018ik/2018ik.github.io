## Background

Consecration is a practice, and involves our consent to God's working in us, using us and directing our ways. Particularly, this working is in our soul: our thoughts, feelings and desires. This must take place first before we are useful to the Lord.

On the other hand, consecration isn't an outward matter; it isn't merely about what we do and our works for God. We could be doing many "good" things of our natural being without a true consecration - that is to consent to God to allow Him to direct us.

Our consecration means that we are willing to work in whatever we are assigned to by God. We should ask the Lord personally how we should go on, and not rely solely on the opinions of those around us.

Consecration should be a daily practice, and a habit. Losing our daily consecration is the beginning of spiritual decline. 

## Aspects
### Basis

The basis behind our consecration is that we are not our own (1 Cor. 6:19) as God has purchased us with a price (1 Cor. 6:20). Technically speaking, our very life is not owned by us or even a joint-ownership between us and God; based on these two verses, God has the entire right of ownership over our lives. Therefore it is altogether normal for us to consecrate ourselves to God. 

This price was paid on the cross, where His blood redeemed us from the demand of the law to Himself. Really, we as fallen human beings should have been on the cross, but He took our place. Thus, If we leave our position of consecration, we are rebellious.

### Motive

Besides the factual basis of our consecration, we are motivated to consecrate by God's love which constrains us (2 Cor. 5:14). If we experience the facts of what Christ went through both on and off the cross, we will see that He loved us despite our sinfulness, which should move our heart to consecrate ourselves.


### Meaning

After we are moved by the compassions of God, we are able to consecrate ourselves and present ourselves a living sacrifice (Rom. 12:1). From the same verse, sacrificing  ourselves in such a way is a *reasonable* service. It isn't too much for us to give our entire being to the Lord, and it isn't anything weird and usual, it is a most reasonable service. What we are, what we could be, what we have and what we could have should all be put on the altar and sacrificed to God.

Just to be clear - such a life is not a miserable life. God's grace will always supply us; it is a most joyous life.

### Purpose

Consecration prior to works is necessary to be used by God and to work for God. Compare living *for* the Lord and living *to* the Lord. To live for the Lord is to give what we have been pursuing, whatever it may be, to the Lord, for His purpose. The live to the Lord implies that what we do in the first place is altogether the Lord's desire. A proper consecration allows us to live to the Lord.

### Result

The result of consecration is that we abandon our future. When we are truly consecrated, we no longer hold onto any thing which can take us back to the world. Many of us continue to hold onto something, and are unwilling to "burn the bridge" which leads back to the world. This is why we need a daily consecration.

The result is also that we enter into the kingdom of the heavens. 



## Tips 

- If we feel we are weak and unable to consecrate, we can still pray: "Make me *willing* to consecrate myself to you."
