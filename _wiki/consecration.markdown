>"Therefore whether we live or we die, we are the Lord's."

\- Romans 14:8b

## Background

**Consecration** is for a person to consent to God's working in them, to use them and to direct their ways. This can be described as offering oneself as a living sacrifice to God (Rom. 12:1). When one puts aside their natural life, God is given the ground to move. His move takes place from the spirit to the soul, [transforming](../transformation) one's thoughts, feelings and desires. Consecration must take place first before one is useful to the Lord.

Undoubtedly, consecration isn't an outward matter; it isn't merely about what we do and our works for God. We could be doing many "good" things of our natural being without a true consecration. True consecration means that we are willing to work in whatever environment we are assigned to by God. We should ask the Lord personally how we should go on, and not rely solely on the opinions of those around us.

Consecration should be a daily practice, and a habit. Losing our daily consecration is the beginning of spiritual decline. 

## Aspects

### Basis

The basis behind our consecration is that we are not our own (1 Cor. 6:19) as God has purchased us with a price (1 Cor. 6:20). Technically speaking, our very life is not owned by us or even a joint-ownership between us and God; based on these two verses, God has the entire right of ownership over our lives. Therefore it is altogether normal for us to consecrate ourselves to God. 

This price was paid on the cross, where His blood redeemed us from the demand of the law to Himself. Really, we as fallen human beings should have been on the cross, but He took our place. Thus, If we leave our position of consecration, we are rebellious and in an abnormal condition..

### Motive

Besides the factual basis of our consecration, we are motivated to consecrate by God's love which constrains us (2 Cor. 5:14). If we experience the facts of what Christ went through both on and off the cross, we will see that He loved us despite our sinfulness, which should move our heart to consecrate ourselves.

### Meaning

After we are moved by the compassions of God, we are able to consecrate ourselves and present ourselves a living sacrifice (Rom. 12:1). From the same verse, sacrificing  ourselves in such a way is a *reasonable* service. It isn't too much for us to give our entire being to the Lord, and it isn't anything weird and usual, it is a most reasonable service. What we are, what we could be, what we have and what we could have should all be put on the altar and sacrificed to God.

Just to be clear - such a life is not a miserable life. God's grace will always supply us; it is a most joyous life.

### Purpose

Consecration prior to works is necessary to be used by God and to work for God. Compare living *for* the Lord and living *to* the Lord. To live for the Lord is to give what we have been pursuing, whatever it may be, to the Lord, for His purpose. The live to the Lord implies that what we do in the first place is altogether the Lord's desire. A proper consecration allows us to live to the Lord according to His preparation (Eph. 2:10).

### Result

The result of consecration is that we abandon our future. When we are truly consecrated, we no longer hold onto any thing which can take us back to the world - the whole is burned on the altar (Lev. 1:9). Many of us continue to hold onto something, and are unwilling to "burn the bridge" which leads back to the world. This is why we need a daily consecration.

Thus, we can cooperate with God for His central work and enter into the kingdom of the heavens. 

## Tips 

- If we feel we are weak and unable to consecrate, we can still pray: "Make me *willing* to consecrate myself to you."
- Don't make excuses regarding consecration; just because other people have a "lower" consecration does not make having a partial consecration acceptable. It is *normal* for man to rely altogether on God for all things. 
- Don't be so dramatic - "oh, now I need to hand over all these things, I'm going to suffer now, etc." The Lord does not care about the outward matter of handing over things. He cares about flowing in, before flowing out. He firstly needs the opening which is our consent.
- Don't wait for things to go badly and for the world to reject you before consecrating yourself; one can consecrate themselves at any time. Actually, a more powerful consecration is when you hand over the things that you treasure to God while you have them.
