## Background

Organic salvation refers to a salvation through the life of God which is needed to attain a full salvation. This is the continued subjective saving from sin, death, the flesh, and the self which occurs after the objective salvation of judicial redemption. The issue of organic salvation is one who is mature in life, reigning in life, and one with God in life, nature and function for the building up of the Body of Christ. The key to organic salvation is the spirit.

## Biblical Basis

Being regenerated i.e. saved positionally is not the end of God's salvation work. Believers can still be saved much more (Rom. 5:10), and grow unto salvation (2 Pet. 2:2). Although a newly saved one is a genuine child of God, they must grow into full-grown God-men (1 Cor 2:6; 14:20; 16:13; Eph 4:13; Phil 3:15; Col 1:28; Heb 5:14).

## History

The line of this inner life began with Madame Guyon and other mystics, whose writings were improved by William Law. These works were later used by Andrew Murray, whose works were used by Jessie Penn-Lewis whose works were used by T. Austin-Sparks, whose works were used by Watchman Nee, whose works were used by Witness Lee.

## Steps

There are six major steps to God's organic salvation, which are accomplished by the joining of the Holy Spirit with the human spirit as one mingled spirit:

1. Regeneration
2. Sanctification
3. Renewing
4. Transformation
5. Conformation
6. Glorification

However these steps can also include two practical steps of shepherding and building as follows:

3. Sanctification

6. **Building**
7. Conformation
