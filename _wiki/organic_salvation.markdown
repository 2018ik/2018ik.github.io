## Background

Organic salvation refers to a salvation through the life of God which is needed to attain a full salvation. This is the continued subjective saving from sin, death, the flesh, and the self which occurs after the objective salvation of judicial redemption.

## Significance

Being regenerated i.e. saved positionally is not the end of God's salvation work. Believers can still be saved much more (Rom. 5:10), and grow unto salvation (2 Pet. 2:2). Although a newly saved one is a genuine child of God, they must grow into full-grown God-men (1 Cor 2:6; 14:20; 16:13; Eph 4:13; Phil 3:15; Col 1:28; Heb 5:14).

## History

The line of this inner life began with Madame Guyon and other mystics, whose writings were improved by William Law. These works were later used by Andrew Murray, whose works were used by Jessie Penn-Lewis whose works were used by T. Austin-Sparks, whose works were used by Watchman Nee, whose works were used by Witness Lee.
