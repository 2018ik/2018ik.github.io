## Background

In Revelation 5, Christ is portrayed as the **Lion** of the tribe of Judah (Rev. 5:5) and a **Lamb** standing as having just been slain (Rev. 5:6). As a lion, He fights against the enemy, and as a lamb, He accomplished redemption for mankind; to the enemy He is a lion, to man He is a lamb. 

## Significance

By overcoming as the Lion and redeeming His people as the Lamb, He was qualified to open the scroll with seven seals (Rev. 5:9). He is also standing, which is for the carrying out of His ongoing heavenly administration in ascension.
