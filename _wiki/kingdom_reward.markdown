The **kingdom reward** which is the prize (1 Cor. 9:24; Phil. 3:14), the crown of righteousness (2 Tim. 4:8), the joy of the master (Matt. 25:21), and the coming Sabbath rest (Heb. 9:4) refers to the reward to the overcomers (Rev. 2:26) who will reign with Christ in the millennial kingdom (Rev. 20:6).
