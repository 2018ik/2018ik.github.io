## Background

The **kingdom reward** is the prize given to overcoming believers and is based on righteousness through works (Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12; 2 Cor. 5:10). This could be considered the prize given to the winner of a race (1 Cor. 9:24; Phil. 3:14), such as a crown (2 Tim. 4:8). It could also be likened to those who are faithful to their master's will entering into the joy of their master (Matt. 25:21). Literally, the kingdom reward is to reign with Christ during the millennium.  

## Purpose

God knows that not all His children are going to be faithful to Him, thus, He promises a reward to those who would pursue Him in this age.

## Rewards

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Crown | In an athletics competition during the time, a crown was not a participation trophy. It was only given to the winners (1 Cor. 9:24). |
| Throne | The overcomers will sit with Christ on His throne to reign over the earth during the millennium (Rev. 3:21; Rev. 20:4). |
| Iron Rod | The iron rod is for authority over the nations so as to shepherd them (Rev. 2:26-27). In the parable of the minas in Luke 19:11-27, the Lord sets His slaves over ten cities and give cities. This is a picture of the overcomers' reigning over the nations. |
| Joy | In the parable of talents in Matthew 25:14-30, the Lord tells the useful slaves to enter into the "joy of your master." This is an enjoyment beyond what we can experience today. |
