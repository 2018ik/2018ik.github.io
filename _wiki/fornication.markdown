## Background

Fornication in the physical sense is a sin against one's own body (1 Cor. 6:18). In the spiritual sense however it is to use the body for something other than God. This could be as innocuous as using one's mouth to gossip. 

## Biblical Basis

The Holy Spirit occupies the physical bodies of the believers, which are the temple of God (1 Cor. 6:19), which is for God’s glorification. When someone participates in an activity, the temple of God is likewise participating in that activity. For example, if someone chooses to gamble or gossip, it is a shame to the Lord’s temple, that is to God Himself.
