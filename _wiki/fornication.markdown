## Background

**Fornication** in the physical sense is a sin against one's own body (1 Cor. 6:18), and it is explicitly stated that those living in fornication cannot inherit the kingdom of God (1 Cor. 6:9). This is one of many ways in which Satan damages the human vessel so that it cannot be used for God's purpose.

In the spiritual sense, fornication is to use the body for something other than God, and is an aspect of idolatry. To worship idols is in a sense to prostitute oneself to demons (Lev. 17:7). This could be as innocuous as using one's mouth to gossip. 

## Biblical Basis

The Holy Spirit occupies the physical bodies of the believers, which are the temple of God (1 Cor. 6:19), which is for God’s glorification. When someone participates in an activity, the temple of God is likewise participating in that activity. For example, if someone chooses to gamble or gossip, it is a shame to the Lord’s temple, that is to God Himself.
