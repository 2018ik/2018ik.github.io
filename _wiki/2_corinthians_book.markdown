### Vessel

Paul says that the believers have a treasure in earthen vessels (2 Cor. 4:7). The treasure of the all-inclusive Christ was not placed into a precious vase, but an earthen vessel. This is an incomprehensible spiritual paradox, yet genuine Christianity. This earthen vessel is excessively burdened beyond its power, and can shatter at any moment, but its confidence is not on itself but God (2 Cor. 1:8-9). In this way, the excellency of the power of God can be made known.
