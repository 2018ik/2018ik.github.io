## Background

**Second Corinthians** reveals what kind of person Paul was: someone who was spiritual and has learned to take Christ as grace despite His sufferings, oppositions, rejections and sorrows. In contrast to 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians 

## Summary

## Topics

### Vessel

Paul says that the believers have a treasure in earthen vessels (2 Cor. 4:7). The treasure of the all-inclusive Christ was not placed into a precious vase, but an earthen vessel. This is an incomprehensible spiritual paradox, yet genuine Christianity. This earthen vessel is excessively burdened beyond its power, and can shatter at any moment, but its confidence is not on itself but God (2 Cor. 1:8-9). In this way, the excellency of the power of God can be made known.

### Grace

The last verse of this book - "the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit" has the ordering Christ, God (the Father) and the Holy Spirit. Unlike the usual Father, Son, Spirit ordering of the Trinity seen in Matthew 28:19, the grace of Christ is mentioned first. This is because 2 Corinthians is a book about grace.

Paul prayed for the thorn to be removed from his side, but this was never answered according to his prayer. This is because God's grace was sufficient for him.
