## Background

**Second Corinthians** reveals what kind of person Paul was: someone who was spiritual and has learned to take Christ as grace despite His sufferings, oppositions, rejections and sorrows. According to Watchman Nee, 2 Corinthians is the deepest book in the New Testament, and could be considered an autobiography of the apostle Paul. The ministers of the new covenant are constituted with all the aspects of the Lord revealed in this book through the constituting work of the Spirit which takes place through sufferings, consuming pressures and the killing work of the cross (2 Cor. 1:8-12; 4:5-13; 11:28-30; 12:7-9).


## Summary

## Topics

### Vessel

Paul says that the believers have a treasure in earthen vessels (2 Cor. 4:7). The treasure of the all-inclusive Christ was not placed into a precious vase, but an earthen vessel. This is an incomprehensible spiritual paradox, yet genuine Christianity. This earthen vessel is excessively burdened beyond its power, and can shatter at any moment, but its confidence is not on itself but God (2 Cor. 1:8-9). In this way, the excellency of the power of God can be made known.

### Grace

The last verse of this book - "the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit" has the ordering Christ, God (the Father) and the Holy Spirit. Unlike the usual Father, Son, Spirit ordering of the Trinity seen in Matthew 28:19, the grace of Christ is mentioned first. This is because 2 Corinthians is a book about grace.

Paul prayed for the thorn to be removed from his side, but this was never answered according to his prayer. This is because God's grace was sufficient for him.

### Aspects of the Spirit

1. The anointing Spirit is the compound Spirit moving within the believers to impart all of God's divine ingredients into us (2 Cor. 1:21).
2. The sealing Spirit forms the divine elements into an impression to express God's image (2 Cor. 1:22).
3. The pledging Spirit gives a foretaste as a sample and guarantee of the full taste of God (2 Cor. 1:22).
4. The inscribing Spirit writes Christ into the believers to make them living letters of Christ (2 Cor. 3:3)
5. The life-giving Spirit imparts the divine life into one's being to make them men of life with the ministry of life (2 Cor. 3:6).
6. The ministering Spirit imparts all that Christ is into the believers makes it real to them (2 Cor. 3:8)
7. The freeing Spirit frees from the bondage of letter and of the law (2 Cor. 3:17).
8. The transforming Spirit dispenses the divine life and nature into the believers to metabolically change them in their inner being (2 Cor. 3:18).
9. The transmitting Spirit transmits all the Christ is with the riches of the Triune God into the believers (2 Cor. 13:14)

### Ministries

Second Corinthians reveals three aspects of the carrying out of God's New Testament economy: the ministry of the Spirit, the ministry of righteousness and the ministry of reconciliation.
