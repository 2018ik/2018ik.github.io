## Background

## Summary

## Topics

### Good Soldier

As good soldiers, believers must suffer evil to please God (2 Tim. 2:3-4). As enlisted ones, believers must be willing to move to where the battle is, such as in GTCA.

### Unashamed Workman

Unashamed workman are those who cut straight the word of the truth (2 Tim. 2:15). This is to continue steadfastly in the apostle's teaching (Acts 2:42). Many Christian teachers today teach vague and incorrect things which only serve to shipwreck other's faith. 

### Your Ministry

At the end of his course, Paul charges Timothy to fulfill his own ministry (2 Tim. 4:5). It didn't matter whether Paul said "my" or "your" ministry to Timothy, because they are one and the same. This is the ministry of the word, which is to minister Christ in all His riches for the building up of the Body of Christ.
