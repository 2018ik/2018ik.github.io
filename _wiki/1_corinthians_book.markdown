## Background

**First Corinthians** describes a realistic church life which was full of problems, in contrast to the ideal church life described prior in Romans 12-16, and the solution to these problems being Christ. The churches of today are no better than the Corinthians, especially in terms of the believers' inner being. In this book, there is the spiritual, the soulish, and the fleshly. In fact, during this time to call someone a Corinthian was an insult due to their degraded condition. Paul's intention was to solve the problems among the saints in Corinth, of which there are 11: 

1. Divisions
2. Marriage life
3. Lawsuits
4. Preferences
5. TODO

However for all the problems, especially divisiveness, the only solution is the enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ, which is repeatedly emphasized. In fact, Paul did not determine to know anything among the Corinthians except the Christ who was crucified (1 Cor. 2:2). There are over twenty aspects of Christ that is revealed throughout the book: God's wisdom, God's power, righteousness, sanctification, etc.

## Summary

The goal of 1 Corinthians was to motivate the Corinthian believers to aspire to the growth in life that they might become spiritual men.

10. The Passover: not just the lamb, He is the entire passover, including eating the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs. To have Christ as the unleavened bread is to have a sinless life. To eat with bitter herbs is to regret and repent, and to have bitterness toward sinful things.

## Divisions

Corinthians talks about divisions; can any one of us say we are not divisive in the least bit?

To think that there are no problems in our church life is a foolish thought. Even the 12 disciples in the Gospels were foolish; the only person that could've dealt with all of them was Jesus Christ.

## Marriage Life

1 Corinthians 7 reveals how Paul deals with marriage life. But rather than focusing on the marriage itself, he instead focuses on Christ.
