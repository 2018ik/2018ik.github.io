## Background

The **broken cisterns** hewed out by the children of Israel portrays their toil in human labor to make something to replace God (Jer. 2:13). Yet, these cisterns were broken and could hold no water indicating that nothing apart from God dispensed into man's vessel as living water can quench man's thirst (John 4:14).
