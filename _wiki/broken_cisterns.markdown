## Background

The **broken cisterns** hewed out by the children of Israel portrays their toil in human labor to make something to replace God (Jer. 2:13). The cisterns holding no water means that they were worthless and could not satisfy man's thirst. 

Cisterns were used in the past to collect rainwater during dry seasons. These were made of rock using primitive tools, and could take months or years to carve out. A person could work for months or years on a cistern, but eventually the rock could crack, rendering the cistern meaningless. This typifies human life without taking God as the source: great time and effort spent on some work, only to realize that it is all vanity. Nothing apart from God dispensed into man's vessel as living water can satisfy (John 4:14).
