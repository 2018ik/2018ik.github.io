## Background

Abba is an aramaic word which means Father. As sons of God with a spirit of sonship, we are able to cry out "Abba, father!" (Rom. 8:15, Gal. 4:6). The combining of the Aramaic title with the Greek title expresses a stronger affection in crying to the Father. This affectionate cry implies an intimate  relationship in life between a genuine son and a begetting father.

A person who cannot laugh or cry cannot be spiritual. The Spirit of the Son which is sent into our *hearts* which allows us to cry "Abba, Father!" (Gal. 4:6). One should feel a deep, sweet intimate sense in the heart when calling toward the Father is this way.
