## Background

The care one has for the new believer should be like a nursing mother (1 Thes. 2:7). 

## Significance

A nursing mother has no dignity, and exists solely to serve and to cherish her children. When the baby cries out at 2 am, the mother does not complete her entire morning routine before exhorting the baby to go back to sleep with the maternal authority. Instead, she simply goes in whatever disheveled state she is in and provides the baby with the care it needs.

Raising up the new believers requires the affectionate care of a nursing mother, yearning over them despite all labor and travail (1 Thes. 2:8-9).
