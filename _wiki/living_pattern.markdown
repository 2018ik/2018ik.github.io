## Background

A [person's living](../person_living) sets a pattern which new believers will follow. 

## Significance

The Lord's work is not just a matter of giving messages, preaching the gospel or performing service work, but it requires a living that is a pattern to new believers. Paul did not just preach the gospel, but he lived what he preached, that his spiritual children would conduct themselves as he did (1 Thes. 1:5; 2:7-2:12).
