## Background

Despite Christ being so high, omnipotent and all-inclusive, His dispensing occurs in an ordinary way. Everyone likes spectacular events, but with regards to the growth of a human being, it's actually a good thing to be ordinary. 

## Biblical Basis

Out of Jesus' 33 and a half years, by and large over 30 years He pretty much lived a normal life. Furthermore during His ministry, His miracles were to deal with the situation, not to project Himself, as He often hid Himself after each miracle. He didn't come to be worshipped or admired by people, but actually just to dispense Himself into man as a sower of seeds.

## Implication

Regardless of how we feel, the fact is that dispensing continues, and we will grow.  This is our future, this is our destiny, we all have a hope of glory, that glory is that full realization of God's organic salvation to bring us to the stage of glorification for us to become Him in life and nature.
