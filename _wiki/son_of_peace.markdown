## Background

A **son of peace** as in Luke 10:6 in the context of preaching the gospel is someone who readily receives the gospel. The Lord sent out the disciples two-by-two as lambs in the midst of wolves to visit people in their houses (Luke 10:3-5). Then, if the house has a son of peace, the disciples' peace will rest upon them, and they would remain in the house to eat and drink (Luke 10:6-7). 

## Significance

There are four significances here. Firstly, this passage shows that it is God's sovereignty whether or not someone is receptive to the gospel. Whether it is a wolf or a son of peace, it is up to God. You could also say it is up to prayer which releases God's will. No matter how convincing, eloquent or charismatic someone is, it is difficult to speak the gospel into a "wolf." Therefore, one should pray that they be led to the sons of peace.  

Secondly, one should be discouraged if someone is not receptive to the gospel. The Lord says your peace shall "return upon you" (Luke 10:6). Being rejected is just an opportunity to bring peace upon another house. 

Thirdly, the disciples visited people in their homes. This is essentially what door-knocking is, and serves to build up new believers in their homes. According to the God-ordained way, it is not enough to hold large gospel meetings and to meet in the church building, but fellowship in small groups within homes allows for believers to meet each other's individual needs.

Lastly, it says to *remain* in that house, and to not go from house to house. This different from Acts 2:46 when the disciples would break bread from house to house. This is because the subject here is on nourishing a newly saved one. To bear remaining fruit, one must continue to nurse their "children" so that they can grow in life (1 Thes. 2:7).
