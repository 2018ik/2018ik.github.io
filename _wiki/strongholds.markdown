## Background

**Strongholds** are fortified structures built to defend against attacks, and are used by Paul to describe Satan's control of the human mind (2 Cor. 10:4-5). This includes reasonings, thoughts and imaginations in the soul which stand against the knowledge of God. For example, pride is a stronghold which has a grasp on many people which causes them to rise up against God and His people. The only way to overthrow these strongholds is through spiritual warfare, not fleshly means.
