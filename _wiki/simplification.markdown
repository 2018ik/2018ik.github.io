## Background

When approaching the Lord, it is important to be simple as people are often too complicated. These complications are due to veils, and the intricacies of the mind, emotion and will.

Even Bible knowledge can be a veil, if it distracts from what Christ is revealing at the present moment. For example, when one pray-reads, they may draw connections from that verse to another verse, and that other verse to a message they listened to in the past, and so on. If all of this is going on in their natural mind, it will distract from what God is trying to reveal to them through the pray-reading. To be simplified is to be fully single towards God, and to only care about what He reveals.
