## Background

**Receiving** is the paradigm through which God dispenses Himself into His people as the Spirit. The Spirit is first received through regeneration; then, the Spirit is received continually by allowing God to spread in one's being. Receiving is not through one's effort, but by opening up to God as a vessel that God can work Himself into them. The flow is always there, it is simply a matter of whether or not the [gateway into a person's being](../heart) is open.

## Biblical Basis

The Spirit could not be received prior to the Lord's death and resurrection, becoming the life-giving Spirit (John 7:39; 1 Cor. 15:45). Then, the disciples were able to receive the Holy Spirit (John 20:22), as well as all the believers (Rom. 8:15; Gal. 3:2).

## Significance

## Attitude

The proper attitude for receiving can be seen in Mary in Luke 10. She drew near to God, coming to the presence of Jesus. Next, she was at His feet, indicating humbleness. Furthermore, she sat down, signifying inward quietness and inaction, rather instead simply listening to the Lord's word. Those who are busy with their own thoughts and ambitions are distracted and cannot receive revelation easily.
