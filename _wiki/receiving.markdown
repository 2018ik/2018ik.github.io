## Background

**Receiving** is the paradigm through which God dispenses Himself into His people. Receiving is not through one's effort, but by opening up to God as a vessel that God can work Himself into them. The flow is always there, it is simply a matter of whether or not the [gateway into a person's being](../heart) is open.

## Significance

## Attitude

The proper attitude for receiving can be seen in Mary in Luke 10. She drew near to God, coming to the presence of Jesus. Next, she was at His feet, indicating humbleness. Furthermore, she sat down, signifying inward quietness and inaction, rather instead simply listening to the Lord's word. Those who are busy with their own thoughts and ambitions are distracted and cannot receive revelation easily.
