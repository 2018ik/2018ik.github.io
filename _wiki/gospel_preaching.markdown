## Background

To preach the gospel is to live and walk by Christ such that He is dispensed into others for the building up of the Body of Christ. Practically, this involves the believers' going out in order to save sinners, but the full content of the gospel includes a full salvation, not merely a judicial redemption. The way to preach the gospel as seen in the saints of the early church is the God-ordained way.

## Significance

The Lord charges all believers to bear fruit, and for the fruit to remain (John 15:16). Preaching the gospel is not an option, the Lord's people are "set" into the vine in John 15, for the express purpose of bearing fruit. 

## Practice

The idea is to not only spend dedicated time to preach the gospel, but to be constituted with the truth such that the living out of Christ becomes spontaneous, that the gospel can be preached in every mundane daily task: getting groceries, going to the bank, etc. Furthermore, one should be praying at all times for those around them.

This requires consistent practice. Just like exercise of the physical body, and the cultivation of the soul, the spirit also needs to be exercised, particularly with respect to speaking Christ. Most people work 8 hours a day, and have weekends off. This provides plenty of time to go out in gospel teams to practice preaching the gospel.
