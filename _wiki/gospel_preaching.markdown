## Background

**Gospel preaching** is to live and walk by Christ such that the overflow of the inner life is dispensed into others for the building up of the Body of Christ. Practically, this involves the believers' going out to speak to sinners. The full content of the gospel includes not only judicial redemption, but a full salvation (Rom. 5:10). The way to preach the gospel as seen in the saints of the early church is the God-ordained way.

## Significance

The Lord charges all believers to bear fruit, and for the fruit to remain (John 15:16). Preaching the gospel is not an option, the Lord's people are "set" into the vine in John 15, for the express purpose of bearing fruit. 

## Practice

The idea is to not only spend dedicated time to preach the gospel, but to be constituted with the truth such that the living out of Christ becomes spontaneous, that the gospel can be preached in every mundane daily task: getting groceries, going to the bank, etc. Furthermore, one should be praying at all times for those around them.

This requires consistent practice. Just like exercise of the physical body, and the cultivation of the soul, the spirit also needs to be exercised, particularly with respect to speaking Christ. 

### Listen

Listen to what they have to say, especially their struggles, anger and disappointments i.e. the darkness which they need to be set free from. It is easy to latch onto a positive thing they say regarding the Lord, and to share something of personal enjoyment. However, what truly touches and convicts someone is speaking regarding what they are bound by.

### Dedicated Time

Most people work 8 hours a day, and have weekends off. This provides plenty of time to go out in gospel teams to practice preaching the gospel.

### Little Speakings

Little speakings mean a lot. the gospel does not mean most of th time you give a long message, it means little speakings. The Lord presented himself as the sower who sows the seed of life into humanity. Just little sowings, little waterings, and little speakings mean a lot over a long period of time.

### Praying 

Don't expect anybody to receive Christ without our prayer.

The Lord cannot move unless we cooperate with Him. Prayer was involved, fasting was involved, and to go. That doesn't mean every time we go there's outward success. More times there's not. But we have somebody else that would never give up because even when He came to the earth, did He have outward success? But thousands rejected and even crucified.
