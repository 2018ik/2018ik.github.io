## Background

God has an **economical operation** throughout the Scriptures in time. God had to enter time in order to carry out His plan, as it involves man who is inherently bound by time. 

In the Old Testament, the single, but Triune God from eternity past in the Old Testament created man for His expression, called out a nation from which He could come forth as a man, and indicated types, shadows, figures and prophecies which were fulfilled and realized by Christ.

In the New Testament, there is the full ministry of Christ in incarnation, inclusion and intensification. The consummation of all of this is the corporate God in eternity future revealed by Revelation 21-22 as the New Jerusalem.

The centrality of God's economy is Christ, as the embodiment of the Triune God.
