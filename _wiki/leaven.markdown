## Background

Leaven in the Bible signifies sin, evil, different and strange teachings, and other negative things (Matt. 16:6; 23:25; Luke 12:1) which mix with the genuine church (Matt. 13:33). 

## Types

In the four Gospels, there are three types of leaven explictly stated, that of the:
1. Pharisees, signifying hypocrisy (Luke 12:1)
2. Sadducees, signifying modernism (Matt. 16:6)
3. Herod, signifying politics (Mark 8:15). 

However, it can be seen from this that leaven is anything apart from Christ which is mixed with the church.

### Hypocrisy

Hypocrisy is to maintain a false appearance without the inward reality. This is to "cleanse the outside of the cup and the fish, but inwardly they are full of extortion and self-indulgence" (Matt. 23:25). This is also signified by Babylon, which is gilded with treasures and ornaments for merely an outward display (Rev. 17:4-6).

### Modernism

The Sadducees denied resurrection, angels and spirits (Acts 23:8). This is to go beyond what is actually said in the Bible, like today's modernism. This is to reconcile and interpret the Bible with modern logic and cultural standards. For example, the Jefferson Bible with all of the miracles cut out to serve solely as a book of ethics and morals. This is also to dilute the Bible to in order to please modern society. 

### Politics

To do anything without the leading of the Lord is to play politics. To please men in the way of pretense and diplomacy to avoid offending others will only serve as a stumbling to the church. Instead, all should be contacted in an honest and faithful way to minister Christ as life to them.

### Different Teachings

### Hierarchy

### Lording Over

To lord over the flock is to instruct someone to do something without leading them to first pray and honor the Lord (1 Pet. 5:3). This is to insult the lordship and headship of Christ. Likewise, to do anything because of a certain brother's instruction apart from going to the Lord in prayer is to insult the lordship and headship of Christ.

### Reviling Words

To revile is to rebuke or critize harshly or abusively. These are ones who beat their fellow slaves (Matt. 24:49). 

### Lukewarmness

To think one knows and to not follow God's up-to-date ministry of the word is leaven. God is always living and moving, and moves through His speaking (1 Tim. 4:6; 2 Tim 3:10).

### Following an Individual

To follow a controlling person rather than a controlling vision is leaven (Acts 26:19).

### Localism

An independent local church is a local sect. A local church must not be independent and autonomous, but be blend together into the reality of the Body of Christ. The local churches are not the goal of God's economy, they are merely a vehicle to reach the goal of the reality of the Body of Christ.
