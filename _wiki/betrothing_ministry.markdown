## Background

The **betrothing ministry** refers to an aspect of Paul's ministry where He wanted to betroth the believers to Christ (2 Cor. 11:2). However, he feared that as the serpent distracted Eve from the tree of life, the believers would be distracted from the simplicity and purity toward Christ (2 Cor. 11:3).
