## Background

**Dispositional sanctification** is to [sanctify](../sanctification) one's inward fallen nature by the Spirit organically and is deeper and more subjective than positional sanctification. While positional sanctification takes place rather easily and in a short time, dispositional sanctification takes a long time. First, God sanctifies His people positionally, then He saturates us with Himself dispositionally.

Dispositional sanctification is one of the eight steps of God's organic salvation, an ongoing process for a believers' perfection (2 Thes. 2:13; Heb. 2:11; 10:14).

## Biblical Basis

Key verses:

>That He might sanctify her, cleansing *her* by the washing of the water in the word,

\-Eph. 5:26 

>I speak in human *terms* because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves to uncleanness and lawlessness unto lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness unto sanctification.

\-Rom. 6:19

>But now, having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end, eternal life.

\-Rom. 6:22
