## Background

Eliakim (meaning "Jehovah will establish him") is a steward of Hezakiah in the Old Testament and a picture of Christ. Hezekiah's storehouse represents the unsearchable riches of Christ, and Eliakim was given the key of David to control the door of this treasury.

## Significance

When God created us, He hired us as Shebnah, and when He put us on the cross, crucifying us with Christ, He fired us (Gal. 2:20). When we were resurrected together with Christ, He re-hired us as Eliakim, who is Christ mingled with us. Now Christ has come to live in us, with us, by us, and through us. The real church life is a life in which all the saints fired and replaced with Christ, making Christ everything in the church.
