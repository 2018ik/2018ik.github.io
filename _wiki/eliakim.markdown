## Background

Eliakim (meaning "Jehovah will establish him") is a steward of Hezakiah in the Old Testament and a picture of Christ. Hezekiah's storehouse represents the unsearchable riches of Christ, and Eliakim was given the key of David to control the door of this treasury.

## Significance

When God created us, He hired us, and when He put us on the cross, crucifying us with Christ, He fired us (Gal. 2:20). This is protrayed by Shebnah, the "old I" who is replaced by Eliakim, the "new I." Through this process Christ has come to live in us, with us, by us, and through us. The real church life is a life in which all the saints re fired and replaced with Christ, making Christ everything in the church.
