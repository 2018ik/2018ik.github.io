## Background

The **old man** is the created and fallen man, which has been crucified by Christ (Rom. 6:6). The old man calls himself by the old "I" as in the first half of Galatians 2:20, and the life of the old man is the soul-life or natural life. When the soul life is lived out, it becomes the flesh, which is just the subjective living of the old man.
