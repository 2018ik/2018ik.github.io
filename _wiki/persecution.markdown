## Background

**Persecution** is Satan manifested in the flesh to oppose the advancement of God's economy. The source of persecution is Satan, and the motive of persecution is jealousy. The result of persecution, however should be our motivation to carry out the Lord's commission. In the Bible, the Lord Jesus was persecuted no doubt by the enemy, but this was for the accomplishment of His redemption. Likewise, the church in Jerusalem was persecuted, but this resulted in the spread of the gospel (Acts 8:4).

## Significance

## Motive

The motive of persecution can be understood as jealousy throughout the Scriptures. The first instance of this was Cain slaying Abel due to God's favoring of Abel's offering. In the NT, the Pharisees persecuted the Lord Jesus out of jealousy (John 11:47-48).
