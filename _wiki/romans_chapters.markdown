## Background

## 8

Romans 8 reveals the center of the universe - the Spirit in man's spirit. Many try to search for and pursue what they consider to be the center of their lives or the universe, however the center is actually within them.

There are 4 interchangeable titles used in Romans 8:9-11: the Spirit of God, Spirit of Christ, Christ and the Spirit of the One.

## 12

Romans 12 reveals the goal of the individual sanctification and transformation seen in the prior chapters, that is the Body of Christ (Rom. 12:4).
