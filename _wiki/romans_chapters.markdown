## Background

## 8

Romans 8 reveals the center of the universe - the Spirit in man's spirit. Many try to search for and pursue what they consider to be the center of their lives or the universe, however the center is actually within them.

There are 4 interchangeable titles used in Romans 8:9-11: the Spirit of God, Spirit of Christ, Christ and the Spirit of the One.

## 9

Romans 9 shows that everything is based on God's mercy. If we are those who muse on the compassions of God, then we will be moved to give ourselves to God as a living sacrifice. According to the pattern of Abraham, we cannot force ourselves to give ourselves to God. It is only when the God of glory appeared to Abraham did he build an altar to consecrate all that he had. When our consecration is waning, we must pray for the God of glory to attract us to Himself.

## 12

Romans 12 reveals the goal of the individual sanctification and transformation seen in the prior chapters, that is the Body of Christ (Rom. 12:4).
