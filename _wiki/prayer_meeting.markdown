>"Your words were found and I ate them"

\- Acts 6:4

## Background

The prayer meeting of church is a meeting where the saints come together to pray to release God's will. Prayer is very important, even more crucial than the ministering of God's word (note ordering in Acts 6:4). 

There is a flow in the prayer meeting, where the Lord's will is revealed through one member, and we support, confirm, echo and affirm that prayer to ensure that the burden has been adequately released.

The prayer meeting is not just for fighting and victory, but it is also a supply.
