>"Your words were found and I ate them"

\- Acts 6:4

## Background

The **prayer meeting** of church is a meeting where the saints come together to pray to release God's will. Prayer is very important, even more crucial than the ministering of God's word (note the ordering in Acts 6:4). There is a flow in the prayer meeting, where the Lord's will is revealed through one member, and we support, confirm, echo and affirm that prayer to ensure that the burden has been adequately released. The prayer meeting is not just for fighting and victory, but it is also a supply.

There are two kinds of prayer meetings: when the atmosphere is of the Body; each one senses that they are a member and the prayers are very brief. The other kind is when there are long, individual prayers, and many are silent as they don't know what to say. With regards to fighting against the evil forces in the heavenlies, it is a Body matter.

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>The prayer meeting is like a basketball game. Everyone has one goal, but no one needs to hold the ball at the time - no one likes a ball hog. The ball is passed between each player before reaching the goal. If there are 200 people in the prayer meeting and you pray 10 times, not everyone can pray 10 times that's way too much. We are many when we come together to pray, and we need to yield to others. Also, we need to come out of our selves and not be timid but to exercise.
