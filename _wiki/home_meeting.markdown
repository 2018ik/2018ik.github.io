## Background

Home meetings are meetings which are held in new believers' homes. The emphasis here is on raising up the new ones. These meetings are not necessarily for teaching, but for nourishing and cherishing the attendees. These meetings also provide a testimony for the neighbors, and provide an opportunity for witness and gospel preaching. After the new ones have met in the homes and are sufficiently mature in life, they can be brought to the Lord's day meetings.

## Scriptural Basis

In the early church in Acts, the believers met "from house to house" (Acts 2:46; 5:42; 20:20). This is not something that was practiced before in Judaism, it was an altogether new, creative act ordained by God. In fact, the Greek phrase for "from house to house" uses the word *kata* which implies a sense of pervasiveness and totality, that is "down to the last spot." This means that it wasn't just a few houses in which they met, but a large amount of them.
