## Background

**Home meetings** are church meetings which are held in the believers' homes. The early church met primarily in the houses; prayer meetings, gospel meetings and even the church building itself was often in the believers' homes (Acts 12:12; Acts 5:42; Rom. 16:5). 

In the context of the God-ordained way, home meetings are held in new believers' homes, usually after they are baptized. The emphasis here is on nourishing and cherishing the new ones. These meetings are not necessarily for teaching and edification, but for nourishing and cherishing the attendees. These meetings also provide a testimony for the neighbors, and provide an opportunity for gospel preaching. After the new ones have met in the homes and are sufficiently mature in life, they can be brought to the small group and Lord's day meetings. While the big meetings bring people in, the small meetings keep them in and build up the Body.

## Scriptural Basis

After the day of Pentecost, three thousand were brought in one day followed by five thousand. These new believers did not meet according to Jewish tradition in the temples, or according to any Roman or Greek way. In the early church, the believers met "from house to house" (Acts 2:46; 5:42; 20:20). This is not something that was practiced before in Judaism; it was an altogether new, creative act ordained by God. In fact, the Greek phrase for "from house to house" uses the word *kata* which implies a sense of pervasiveness and totality, that is "down to the last spot." This means that it wasn't just a few houses in which they met, but a large amount of them. 

## Significance

The homes are the life-pulse of the church, and the unique way to build up the church. Even the Lord's day church meeting can be in the homes (1 Cor. 16:19).

The way to meet in the homes lasted a very short time, and after the early apostles by the second century, the church began meeting solely in large congregations. As a result, big evangelists were raised up, and each individual member lost their function. Without home meetings, it is difficult for each member of the Body to function, and therefore it is difficult for the Body to be built up.

Meeting in the homes allows each person to open up and share experiences with each other, which allow for mutual building.

## Trivia
