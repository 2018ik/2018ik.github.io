## Background

Home meetings are meetings which are held in believers' homes. If there is only a single meeting each week in the church meeting hall based on a definite, regular schedule, it will be difficult for each member to come into function. The Lord actually wants to build the church through organic gatherings in each believer's home, that the children, relatives, neighbors, and new ones can all be built up. These meetings are not necessarily just for teaching, but for nourishing and cherishing the attendees. These meetings also provide a testimony for the neighbors, and provide an opportunity for witness and gospel preaching. 

## Scriptural Basis

In the early church in Acts, the believers met "from house to house" (Acts 2:46; 5:42; 20:20). This is not something that was practiced before in Judaism, it was an altogether new, creative act ordained by God. In fact, the Greek phrase for "from house to house" uses the word *kata* which implies a sense of pervasiveness and totality, that is "down to the last spot." This means that it wasn't just a few houses in which they met, but a large amount of them.
