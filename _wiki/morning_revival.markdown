## Background

**Morning revival** (or **morning watch**) is a time in the morning to be with the Lord and contact the Lord in order to be filled with the life of God i.e. revived. The Christian life is a day by day life (2 Cor. 4:16) with a new start every morning. According to God's principle of creation, there are many opportunities for new beginnings (new week, month, year, day, etc.), the greatest of all which is the new day. No matter how good or bad the previous day was, we can come back to the Lord every morning; His compassions and mercy are new every morning (Lam. 3:23).

Many patterns show us that the best time to touch the Lord is the morning. While we can continue to contact the Lord later on in the day, many can confirm in their experience that the best fellowship and opening to the Lord is during the morning. This is because it is easy to be swept away by other things throughout the day. There is the most supply and light in the morning.

## Biblical Patterns

### Manna

> "And they gathered [the manna] morning by morning, each one according to his eating, and when the sun became hot, it melted."

\- Exodus 16:21

Manna was a kind of heavenly food which could only be found in the mornings. Past the morning, it will melt. This is a type of the ascended Christ which comes a daily supply for one's daily living. Every morning one should have the sensation that Christ in the heavens is raining down on them to be eaten as food. Having morning revival is to be filled with Lord as food every morning (Exo. 16:12).

### Bread of the Presence

Unlike manna, the bread of the presence is only to be enjoyed by the priests in the presence of God. Presence in Hebrew is the same word for face. When we enter into the Lord's presence, we behold his face.

### Mary

Mary had gone to seek the Lord very early in the morning. 

Mark 16:9 - after He had risen early on the first day of the week He appeared first to Mary. Mary was rewarded with the Lord's appearing due to her seeking early in the morning.

### Abraham

Gen 19:27 He rose up early it the morning and went to the place where he had stood before Jehovah. This is where he was interceding for Lot - rising up early in the morning to see what happened to Lot. Later, his offering of Isaac was also early in the morning (Gen. 22:3).

### Jacob

Gen 28:18-19. After he had the dream of the heavenly ladder, where the Lord spoke to him regarding his descendants, he rose up early in the morning. He took the stone that he had under his head and set it as a pillar and poured oil on top of it, and called the name of that place Bethel.

### Moses

Moses dealt with Pharaoh early (Exo. 9:13). Exodus 34:2,4 Moses rose up early in the morning to go up to Mt. Sinai to receive the 10 commandments.

### Samuel's parents

1 Sam 1:19

### Jeremiah

Jeremiah saw God's lovingkindness and compassions anew every morning (Lam. 3:22-23).

### Various Psalmists

David set forth his words to Jehovah in the morning, that He would hear his voice (Psa. 5:3). Other psalmists also watched for the Lord in the morning (Psa. 119:147; 130:6). Particularly, God is sought out *early* in the day (Psa. 63:1).

### Jesus

### George Muller

When he first started to contact the Lord in the morning, for the first 10 years he would just pray. This was not as profitable as his later experience. For the first 10 mins it would be hard for him to focus, after kneeling down and praying. 

He then learned a secret: after 10 years, he learned to use the Word. He would come to the Lord in the Word, and every morning he would just come to the Word. When he would come he would first offer up a little prayer, then meditate on the Word. He took every verse, and his goal was to get the blessing and supply out of each verse. The result of this is that there is always a good deal of confession, thanksgiving, supplication or intercession mingled with his meditation.

"And that my inner man is most invariably, and even most sensibly, nourished and strengthened"

He would always be in a peaceful and happy state of heart after this morning revival, which he practiced prior to even breakfast. The first thing he worried about was how he might get his soul into a happy state, and how his inner man might be nourished. He found the Lord is often pleased to nourish him, and this spiritual food could also be used to feed others.

### All those who are of any use in God's hands

Believe it or not, but in order to be useful in God's hands, morning revival is essential.

## How to Practice

Entering into the presence of the Lord, and coming face-to-face with Him should be the primary objective of our morning revival. 

### Confession

Each morning, we should confess every sin which the Lord shines on.

### In the Face

We need personal, intimate, and direct contact with the Lord in order to see the Lord's face. The Lord is the one who shines in our hearts to illuminate the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ (2 Cor. 4:6). The Lord is shining and ready all the time, we can come and turn our hearts to the Lord that all the veils may be taken away, that we can behold the face of Jesus Christ.

### Rise up early and go to bed early

This is very practical, it is difficult to have morning revival if we don't wake up in the morning.

### Love the Lord more than the bed

We need to get out bed immediately - don't delay. Right after, speak to the Lord, call on His name and tell Him you love Him.

### Use Your Voice

>"Oh Jehovah, in the morning you will hear my voice!"

\- Psa. 5:3

Our morning time should not just be in our thoughts; it is not a mental exercise. We need to open our mouths audibly, whether by whisper or a ringing shout. The Lord will *hear* the psalmist's voice. Futhermore, the Lord is rich to all who call upon His name (Rom. 8:10); to enjoy the Lord's riches subjectively, one simply needs to call His name. 

### Less Doing

The first step is to contact the Lord; don't start doing your morning routine, or by telling the Lord the various things you are doing to accomplish today. Begin by coming to Him and enjoy His presence.

### Don't Set High Standards

Take it little by little; start with one verse, 5 minutes, build it up over time. Don't be disappointed in not meeting your self-made laws.

### Diligent Habit

This all needs to be done consistently. We never graduate from morning revival. 

### Redeem the Time

Although we all need to start somewhere, we also need to spend adequate time.

### Remind One Another

>"Therefore I will be ready always to remind you concerning these things, even though you know them"

\- 2 Pet. 1:12

Rely on your companions to remind you each morning.

### Not Ritualistic

We should fellowship with the Lord, even regarding our waking up early. This should not be something which we do solely out of our natural self. We need the Lord to open our ear in the morning; we need learn to take the Lord as our full supply.

### Prepare Yourself Practically

Change out of pajamas, stand up, sit up straight, etc. Don't remain lying down. Remember that morning revival is a meeting with God.

### Enjoy the Word

Exercising one's spirit to pray-read and to enjoy the Word is an easy way to get out of the mind and turn to God. It is difficult
