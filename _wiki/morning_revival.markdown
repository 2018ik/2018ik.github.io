## Background

We have a new start every morning. According to God's principle of creation, there are many opportunities for new  beginnings (new week, month, year, day, etc.). We can have a new beginning with the Lord each day. The Lord's compassions and mercy are new every morning (Lam. ??:??).

Our experience also shows us that the best time to touch the Lord is the morning. While we can continue to contact the Lord later on in the day, many can confirm in their experience that the best fellowship and opening to the Lord is during the morning. This is because it is easy to be swept away by other things throughout the day. There is the most supply and light in the morning.


## Pictures of Morning Revival

Many individuals recorded in the Bible contacted the Lord early in the morning.

### Manna

> "And they gathered [the manna] morning by morning, each one according to his eating, and when the sun became hot, it melted."

\- Exodus 16:21

Manna can only be found in the mornings. Past the morning, it will melt.

### Bread of the Presence

Unlike manna, the bread of the presence is only to be enjoyed by the priests in the presence of God. Presence in Hebrew is the same word for face. When we enter into the Lord's presence, we behold his face.

### Mary

Mary had gone to seek the Lord very early in the morning. 

Mark 16:9 - after He had risen early on the first day of the week He appeared first to Mary. Mary was rewarded with the Lord's appearing due to her seeking early in the morning.

### Abraham

Gen 19:27 He rose up early it the morning and went to the place where he had stood before Jehovah. This is where he was interceding for Lot - rising up early in the morning to see what happened to Lot.

### Jacob

Gen 28:18-19. After he had the dream of the heavenly ladder, where the Lord spoke to him regarding his descendants, he rose up early in the morning. He took the stone that he had under his head and set it as a pillar and poured oil on top of it, and called the name of that place Bethel.

### Moses
Exodus 32:2,4 Moses rose up early in th morning to go up to Mt. Sinai to receive the 10 commandments.

### Samuel's parents
1 Sam 1:19

### Jesus

### George Muller

When he first started to contact the Lord in the morning, for the first 10 years he would just pray. This was not as profitable as his later experience. For the first 10 mins it would be hard for him to focus, after kneeling down and praying. 

He then learned a secret: after 10 years, he learned to use the Word. He would come to the Lord in the Word, and every morning he would just come to the Word. When he would come he would first offer up a little prayer, then meditate on the Word. He took every verse, and his goal was to get the blessing and supply out of each verse. The result of this is that there is always a good deal of confession, thanksgiving, supplication or intercession mingled with his meditation.

"And that my inner man is most invariably, and even most sensibly, nourished and strengthened"

He would always be in a peaceful and happy state of heart after this morning revival, which he practiced prior to even breakfast.

The first thing he worried about was how he might get his soul into a happy state, and how his inner man might be nourished.

He found the Lord is often pleased to nourish him, and this spiritual food could also be used to feed others.

### All those who are of any use in God's hands

Believe it or not, but in order to be useful in God's hands, morning revival is essential.

## How to Practice

Entering into the presence of the Lord, and coming face-to-face with Him should be the primary objective of our morning revival. 

## Benefits

As we come to the Lord morning by morning, something fills us to the brim. We also have a surplus (Exo. 16:??), and this surplus is bread to God. 

As we behold the Lord each morning, we are being transformed (2 Cor. 3:18).
