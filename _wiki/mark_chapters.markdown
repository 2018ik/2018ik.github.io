## 5

Great crowds passed by the Lord and pressed onto the Lord, but nothing happened to them. One can easily be in the great crowd, which is good, but end up passing by the Lord with no change. But there was one woman who had a flow of blood, who touched the Lord and was healed. In her faith she reached out and in this real touch the element of life came in. Until a person has a real and genuine touch of the Lord as this woman did, nothing will change. One's touch of the Lord may not be witnessed by anyone else besides themselves and God.
