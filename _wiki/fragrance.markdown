## Background

**Fragrance** refers to the divine and mystical expression of Christ which ministers of Christ spontaneously exude in their [living](../person_living), which satisfies God (Lev. 1:9). This fragrance can be an aroma of life to some, and an aroma of death to others (2 Cor. 2:16). 

## Biblical Basis

2 Corinthians 2:15 describes believers as a fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being saved as well as perishing. The context of this verse is that Christ is leading the captured believers in a procession (see: captive), and during such a procession, there would be incense bearers who scatter incense. Verses 14 and 16 further state that this is also a *savor*, indicating that the fragrance is not only smelled but tasted. 

In Jeremiah 48:11, Moab has been at ease, and as a result, his scent is not changed. The Lord uses many situations, including suffering ones, to change the attributes of His people that they may have the fragrance of Christ.

## Significance

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>Once there was a group of skunks, with the mother skunk walking around out there. Everyone was scared, but why are we scared of that little animal? It's because of the odor, it's powerful. You're driving down the freeway, the windows are closed, then you smell something - you know exactly what it is. Before we got converted to Christ that's the kind of aroma/odor we gave off. Now Christ came into us and He has become our fragrance, and we want to be so saturated by Him that we become a fragrance of Christ.
