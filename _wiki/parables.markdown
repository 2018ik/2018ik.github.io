## Background

**Parables** were stories told by Jesus which masked a hidden significance. The reason why Jesus spoke in parables was to give the seeking ones a chance to understand (by coming to Jesus and asking Him for the meaning) while obscuring its meaning from the blind ones in darkness (who neither cared about nor believed in Jesus and thus would never ask Him for the meaning).
