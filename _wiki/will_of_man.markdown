## Background

The **will** is the part of the soul which can choose, refuse and decide. When one sets their heart to do something, that is an exercise of the will. The will is like a rudder; as a ship turns according to the rudder, a person moves according to their will.  

## Significance

It is a Christian's choice to choose the Lord. According to God's principle of free will, He does not impose Himself on man to force him to choose life or death (as seen in the creation of man). If the human will aligns with God's will, then God's economy can be carried out. This alignment is not up to us to align our will to God, but for us to have God continually dispensed into our being such that God's will and our will become one mingled will as in the mingled spirit.  

## Biblical Basis

Job 7:15 says that the soul can *choose* strangulation. In Job 6:7, we see that the soul can also refuse. 1 Chron. 22:19 shows that the soul can seek after Jehovah. Numbers 30 also talks about binding one's soul, which in context we can see is a matter of making a vow, which is to do with man's will. The Hebrew word *soul* is also occasionally translated into *will* based on context (Psa. 27:12; 41:2).
