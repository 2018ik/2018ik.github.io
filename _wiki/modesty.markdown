## Background

**Modesty** as in 1 Timothy 2:9 means to be "made fast by an honorable shame" (literally, "shamefastness") and is the leading female virtue. This is typified by head covering. A sister should not only be covered physically, but psychologically and spiritually. Such covering is a safeguarding to themselves and to the brothers.
