## Background

In 2 Corinthians there is a transforming Spirit (2 Cor. 3:18) which when attached has many functions: anointing (2 Cor. 1:21), pledging (2 Cor. 1:22), sealing (2 Cor. 1:23), inscribing (2 Cor. 3:3).

## Functions

### Anointing

This function refers to the compound ointment. The compound all-inclusive Spirit is able to anoint us. Anointing implies that new elements are added. 

### Pledging



### Sealing

Whenever something is stamped or sealed, new elements are also added. The distinction of the seal is that it has a distinguishable image and can be understood outwardly by others.

### Inscribing

God is writing Christ as the ink into the believers with the transforming Spirit (2 Cor. 3:3). The parchment is still there, except it is now inscribed with Christ. In a sense, the believers are a letter of Christ which can be read by others.
