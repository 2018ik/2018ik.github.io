## Significance

The first step should always be taking care of the inner man. For example, humans can accompish many extraordinary things, but it is all through simple automatic principles like eating, drinking and breathing. These are all inward matters - we take care of our bodies first, in order that the body can do things. Likewise, we must take care of our inner man first for the proper function.
