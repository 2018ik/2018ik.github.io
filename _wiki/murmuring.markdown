## Background

**Murmurings** are discontented and secret mutterings, grumblings and complaining, typically indistinct, whispered complaining in low tones, with a lack of contentedness and with a gloomy resentment. The children of Israel murmured and perished by the destroyer (1 Cor. 10:10). 

In Numbers 14:2-3, the children of Israel murmured against Moses, stating that it would've been better if they had died in Egypt or the wilderness, and that they would be ome plunder. There is clear resentment and bitterness here. They also murmured within their tents (Psalm 106:25). God however can hear all of man's whispering and murmuring.
