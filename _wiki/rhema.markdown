## Background

**Rhema** is the Greek word in the New Testament which means a subjective "spoken word." This is in contrast to logos, which is the objective, written word. Only the rhema word gives life; the words which the Lord *speaks* are spirit and life (John 6:63). 

First comes the foundation of the logos word, then through one's opening to the Lord, this word becomes rhema and they are transformed. The word *word* in Ephesians 5:26 is a rhema word which washes and sanctifies one's very being.
