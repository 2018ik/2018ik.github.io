## Background

Luke 14:15-24 is a parable regarding salvation involving a certain man who sent out a slave to gather the guests for his banquet. Those who were specifically invited declined the offer for various reasons, so the master then sent the slave to compel strangers to come to the dinner as replacements.

## Significance

The certain man (God) prepared a banquet representing His full salvation and sent out His slave (the apostles) to tell the invited ones (the Jews) the dinner was ready. The invited ones were preoccupied by various things, and excused themselves. Therefore, God's salvation instead went to the strangers, that is the Gentile world.

### Compel

In verse 23, we see that the slave was told to "compel" them to come in. This is with regards to gospel preaching. On one hand, it is by the Lord's mercy that sinners are saved, but on the other hand, the Lord's workers must make an active effort to bring sinners to God.
