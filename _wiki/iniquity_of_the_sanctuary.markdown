## Background

Iniquities of the sanctuary or priesthood are specific sins committed with respect to God's work. This is to build with worthless materials of wood, grass and stubble (1 Cor. 3:12). In God's work everything that is incompatible with God's will is as in and is an inquity of the sanctuary. This is work which is initiated out of oneself, carried out by one's own strength or for the goal of one's own glory.
