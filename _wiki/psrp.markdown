>"What I am speaking here is a kind of instruction to all the churches. My new way is PSRP. This is the way for us to cook and eat the riches that have been released in these recent years."

\- The Vital Groups, pp.142-143

## Background

**PSRP** consists of pray-reading, studying, reciting and prophesying, and is a new and up-to-date way to be constituted with the riches of the Word. This is a practice initiated by the saints in Taiwan and passed on to the rest of the churches in 1996. Although certain practices can distract us, PSRP is a very good practice. This is the recovery of a great practice, just like calling on the name of the Lord (Rom. 10:13).

It's not about just knowing the facts of the Bible, we need the proper understanding and interpretation (Acts 8; Matt. 13:19). Everyone approaches the Bible with their own concepts, and reads the Bible with a particular lens. For example, Baptists may read with an emphasis on baptism, while Seventh-day Adventists read with an emphasis on the Sabbath. It is also easy to read the Bible based on modern philosophical frameworks and Christian tradition, which have nothing to do with the Bible. The practice by which we come to the proper interpretation is PSRP. It is through PSRP that will be able cook and eat the riches of the word and to serve the points of truth to others.

Furthermore, the riches of the word does not refer to something separate from God himself, but it is in fact God himself, thus through PSRP we are further constituted with the Triune God himself.

When prophesying during the prophesying meeting, it is easy for new ones to get lost when everyone is speaking for 2-3 minutes, especially if this speaking is not solid. PSRP can help us solidify our understanding and to speak a solid word.

## How To Practice PSRP

**Pray-reading** the word of God helps us to get into the spirit. Without the spirit, we are merely studying dead letters. Therefore, through pray-reading we can then study crucial points and words of the ministry in a rich way.

When **studying**, we should understand the overall line of thought of what we are reading, as well as the crucial terms. Pay special attention to Bible verse references which strengthen and substantiate each important point. We should also understand the motivation behind the title of the content.

**Recitation** happens spontaneously after studying. This is not necessarily a verbatim repetition, but to be able to repeat the line of thought and the crucial terms. This is based on understanding, not rote memory.

By this point we are at least able to recite with understanding, and therefore we can **prophesy** to others the truth which we have studied. Prophesying in spirit will give structure to and enhance our speaking with further inspiration and enlightenment. When we preach the gospel according to the truth, people will be more interested in what we have to say.

## Tips

- You can PSRP alone, but a group of six to ten is preferable
- Beginners and new ones should seek help from those who are experienced for guidance
- The timing of each part is crucial so that PSRP can be completed in a timely manner
- PSRP is not a shortcut, the amount of time to adequately study a message should be around the same as the length of the message itself (i.e. 60-90 minutes for a typical message)
- The reward is worth the time - your understanding of the truth will be revolutionized!

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

> There was once a very knowledge and high ranking judge in Taiwan, and he considered no one good, since everyone who comes to him was always a sinner. He knew about Christ, but he was not saved. I was considering how to share the gospel with him since he had heard the gospel already. the Lord reminded me: I am a matchmaker, I'm trying to introduce him to someone for marriage. So I share to him that the whole Bible is a divine romance. And he said he's never heard of this. Thank the Lord, later on he was saved. This is the way we need to have the Bible opened to us. This requires getting into the Word through PSRP.
