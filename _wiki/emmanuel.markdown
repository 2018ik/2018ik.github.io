## Background

**Emmanuel** (Hebrew *Immanuel* meaning "God with us") is the name of Jesus. 

## Significance

Emmanuel implies that the infinite God became a finite man to be with man, and became a life-giving Spirit to indwell man.

The incarnated Christ is the individual Emmanuel, the resurrected pneumatic Christ is the practical Emmanuel. The church as the Body of Christ is the corporate Emmanuel. The New Jerusalem is the consummate Emmanuel, the aggregate of Emmanuel the totality of God with man.

Many times believers are governed more by the presence of elders and serving ones than the practical Emmanuel. How one speaks and acts should not be dictated by whether or not someone is present, but by the practical Emmanuel in the spirit.
