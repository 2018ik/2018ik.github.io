## Background

The house of God refers to God's habitation, i.e. wherever He happens to be dwelling at a particular point in time. This could refer to the tabernacle or the Temple in the Old Testament, or the church in the New Testament.

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

> When I was young in China about sixty or seventy years ago, there were families with a great father living with his fourth generation. On the birthday of this great father, all the sons, grandsons, great-grandsons, and great-great-grandsons came together to talk about what they had inherited from their great father and what they were going to inherit. They would talk about what they were doing at that time and about all their interests and possessions, such as properties, houses, lands, schools, etc. They would talk about these things in front of their great father. As the father was listening to them and watching them, he was so happy. The more they talked about these things, the more they gave praises to that great old man and the more they expressed him and manifested him.

>That birthday meeting is a model of our meeting today. Our Fatherâ€™s birthday is eternity, and our meeting today is the birthday meeting of our Father. When we come together, we talk about all that the Father is, all that the Father has done for us, all that the Father has given us, all that the Father is intending to do for us, and [281] about what we have inherited of Him. What we talk about includes whatever the Father has done, is doing, and is going to do. The more we talk about these things in our meeting, the more praise we give to our Father. This kind of speaking makes our Father happy.s
