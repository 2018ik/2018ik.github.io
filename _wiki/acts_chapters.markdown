Acts 2:46-47 presents the normal standard of the Christian life. To produce vital groups and to gain an increase in the church, the things mentioned in these two verses must be applied:
1. "day by day..."
2. "continuing steadfastly with one accord..."
3. "breaking bread from house to house..."
4. "they partook of their food with exultation and simplicity of heart..."
5. "praising God and having grace with all the people..."
6. "the Lord added together those who were being saved..."
