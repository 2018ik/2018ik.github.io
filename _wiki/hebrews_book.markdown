### Dividing of Soul and Spirit

Hebrews 4:12 says that the Word of God divides soul from spirit. This is an indication of maturity in life, and is seen in the record of Jacob realizing that Joseph was still alive. While his heart grew numb, his spirit was revived (Gen. 45:27). Many in the denominations do not know this separation exists, and thus more often than not live in the soul and thereby remain spiritual infants.
