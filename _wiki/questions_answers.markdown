#### God wants man to be subject to deputy authorities (Rom. 13:1). What should a person do if his parents forbid him from going to the meetings? 

There is a difference between subjection/submission and obedience. Acts 5:29 tells us to obey God. To obey is the outward action while being subject to or submitting to someone is a matter of inward motive and attitude. If a mother tells her daughter to come play mahjong, she should not obey, as it is not proper for a Christian to participate in gambling. Yet, she should be fully submissive and respectful; she can lower her head and say "Mother, I do want to honor your word. I wish I could obey you, but I cannot follow you in this matter because I have believed in the Lord."

Whenever there is a conflict between deputy authority and direct authority, we can choose to submit to the deputy authority but not to obey him. Any prohibition of Godâ€™s commission, such as a ban on the preaching of the gospel, should be met with submission, not obedience. However, someone with a rude and uncouth attitude testifies that they have not touched God's authority.
