## Background

The **kiss** signifies one's love and enjoyment toward the Lord. The Bible reveals an intimate relationship between God and man; in God's New Testament economy, to fear, worship, and even receive God is not adequate. He wants His people to kiss the Son (Psa. 2:12), and to love Him (1 Cor. 2:9).
