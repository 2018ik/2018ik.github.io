## Background

The **will of God** is what God wants and His intention to carry out His purpose, that is for us to enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as everything to us to practice the Body of life so that we may become the reality of the Body of Christ, an organic corporate enlargement and expression of Christ.

## Biblical Basis


The will of God is in two aspects: for us to enjoy God's dispensing, and for us to practice the Body life. The former emphasizes the Christ, while the latter emphasizes the church.

Romans 12:2 says that renewing of the mind and transformation proves what the will of God is. Then the following verses indicate that this is for the many to become one Body in Christ (Rom. 12:5). Therefore, God's will is to have the Body life as the practical reality outlined in Romans chapters 12 through 16.

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

> Many Christians ask what is the will of God for my life. This is a very man-centered question. We should be asking what is the will of God for His purpose, for His economy. According to Revelation 4:11, all things were created because of God's will. Sometimes I go for a walk a night and I like to tell each of these creations, the green grass, the trees, you were created because of God's will to gain a Body of His beloved Son. And then the Lord tells me, "You were created because of My will." We owe our very existence as human being to the will of God. Before trying to find out what's the will of God for my life, we need to be clear what God's eternal will is. We need to pray for the Lord's will to be our will, for His desire to be our desire, and for His good pleasure to be our good pleasure.
