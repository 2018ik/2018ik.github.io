## Background

**God's operation** is His inward moving within the believers to instill in them the willing and the working (Phil. 2:13).

## Significance

It doesn't depend on what our situation is, the Triune God is operating. Everything on the outside could be going wrong - Paul in the book of Philippians was not in a great situation, likely chained in a jail - but in the middle of that circumstance, there is the magnification of Christ. In the middle of our circumstances which my be great or horrible, there should be a magnification of Christ. This operation, the enjoyment of the operation and the opening to the operation is what works out our salvation on one hand but it is an experience of our living with the Divine Trinity. Every experience we have can be an opportunity to experience the operation of the Triune God.
