## Background

The present age refers not to the age of the world in a general way, but to the age of today's Christianity in a particular way, especially in relation to the revelation of the Scriptures, the divine truths, and the genuine and proper theology.

Most Christians today focus on the historical Jesus, or the Jesus in the end times at His second coming. We instead need to emphasize the present resurrected and ascended Christ as the life-giving Spirit.

## Christianity Today

1. Christianity today like Judaism emphasizes material things
   1. In the Old Testament, shekinah glory dwelt in the holy of holies. But when the Lord Jesus came, the age of fulfillment had come; He was a walking tabernacle of God. This wonderful person who was the personal dwelling place of God, was enlarged as the corporate dwelling place of God, the church. Yet one of the most common expressions among Christians today is "did you go to church" as if the church is merely a building. 
   2. Likewise, many believe that the Father's many abodes or the New Jerusalem is merely a physical dwelling place in heaven.
2. Christianity today emphasizes earthly blessings
   1. Every genuine blessing God bestows upon us in the New Testament age is a spiritual blessing (Eph. 1:3)
   2. We are poor in material things, but we are rich in spiritual things.
3. Christianity today emphasizes the law of letters, which misses the law of the Spirit of life which frees us from the law of sin and of death
   1. Many are preoccupied by what is right and wrong according to the letter of the word of God. 
4. Christianity today emphasizes a mediatorial class
   1. Clergy and pastoral system in Catholicism and Protestantism respectively.

### Blinding Work

We need to realize that every concept we hold dear to ourselves is a veil, which is the blinding work of the god of this age. Many today are proud in their own understanding, and walking in the vanity of their mind and are therefore unable to see that they are blind.
