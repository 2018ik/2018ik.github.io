## Background

There are many things which are essential, such as eating, drinking, marrying (Matt. 24:38), however taking such things in **excess** becomes worldly. The world has become a place where existence has become the purpose of existence. One exists for the sake of existing and one has to live their best life. However, a believer's existence is for God's economy. When one's existence is purposeful rather than purposeless, they will be blessed.
