## Background

Growth in life is the increase of God's life in believers who have been regenerated with His life.

## Biblical Basis

1 Peter 2:2 states that as newborn babes, you may *grow unto salvation*. Having been reborn, and regenerated with the life of God, one must continue to grow unto a further salvation.

## How To

The basic requirement for growing in life is loving the Lord (1 Pet. 1:8). Next, one must take heed to their spirit, that is to exercise their spirit to contact the Lord (1 Pet. 2:5). Lastly, one must guard their heart with all vigilance (1 Pet. 3:15) to stay on the pathway of life.
