## Background

Growth in life is the increase of God's life in believers who have been regenerated with His life.

The basic requirement for growing in life is loving the Lord (1 Pet. 1:8). Next, one must take heed to their spirit, that is to exercise their spirit to contact the Lord (1 Pet. 2:5). Lastly, one must guard their heart with all vigilance (1 Pet. 3:15) to stay on the pathway of life.

## Biblical Basis

The New Testament reveals growth in life in at least three lines: that of a newborn baby, that of a plant, and that of a seed.

1 Peter 2:2 states that as newborn babes, you may *grow unto salvation*. Having been reborn of Spirit, and regenerated with the life of God (John 3:5), one must continue to grow unto a further salvation.

1 John 3:9 speaks of a divine seed which is planted into the believers. This seed must continue to grow.
