## Background

**Growth in life** is the continued increase of God's life, which is God Himself, in believers who have been regenerated with His life (John 3:5), and is for the building up of the Body.  Growth comes from holding to the truth in love, and to take Christ as the Head of the Body. The Body is supplied by the Head, who adds more of His life into the Body (Eph. 4:15; Col. 2:19). 

Experientially, the basic requirement for growing in life is loving the Lord (1 Pet. 1:8). Next, one must take heed to their spirit, that is to exercise their spirit to contact the Lord (1 Pet. 2:5). Then, one must guard their heart with all vigilance (1 Pet. 3:15) to stay on the pathway of life. Lastly, it is God who causes the growth (1 Cor. 3:6).

The only true indication of growth in life is being filled by God and as a result sensing the life of Christ (Eph. 3:19). Paul counted everything as loss besides Christ (Phil. 3:7).

## Biblical Basis

The New Testament reveals growth in life in at least three lines: that of a newborn baby, that of a plant, and that of a seed.

1 Peter 2:2 states that as newborn babes, you may *grow unto salvation*. The babes here are fed by the guileless milk of the word, which requires loving care and instruction from the other believers (1 Thes. 2:7). Eventually, one may progress from milk to solid food (1 Cor. 3:2), and be present full-grown in Christ (Col. 1:28).

1 John 3:9 speaks of a divine seed which is planted into the believers. This seed must continue to grow.

## What Growth is Not

Growth in life is not the improvement of behavior, to go from evil to good, quick-tempered to slow, impatient to patient. By determination and effort, a person can improve considerably in behavior yet be immature and weak in the life of God. Likewise, the expression of piety and reverence toward God is also not necessarily growth in life. Nuns and monks are very pious and devoted to God and their religion, but that doesn't correlate with maturity in life. 

Peter was someone who was very good and zealous for the Lord. However after God directly told him in a vision that there are no longer ordinances in eating, Peter was "too good" to listen to God. Determining to please God can distract from one's hearing of God.

Even knowledge, gifts and power are not necessarily growth in life. Knowing the Bible without revelation of the Spirit can cause a person to be puffed up and is nothing to God (1 Cor. 8:1; 13:2). Despite the Corinthians beng enriched in all utterance, knowledge and lacks no gift, in life they were immature and infants in Christ (1 Cor. 3:1). The disciples of the Lord received much power to subdue demons and heal diseases, but they were not mature in life.

Paul was highly educated, strictly followed the law, and was zealous for God, persecuting the Way unto death (Acts 22:3-4; Phil. 3:4-6). Furthermore, he was also very gifted. But what caused Paul to count all things as loss was not his self-effort and determination rather it was all "on account of Christ" (Phil. 3:7). This is a true experience of Christ as life.
