## Background

A **life practice** is a practice that issues from growth in the divine life. The word *life* means that the goal is not knowledge or self-improvement but life. To read the Bible, pray-read, and sing is an empty work if there is no source of life behind the practice. The word *practice* implies that there will be many failures from which we can learn.
