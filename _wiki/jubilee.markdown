## Background

The **Jubilee** is the fiftieth year after seven Sabbath years where liberty is proclaimed throughout the land of Israel (Lev. 24:8-10), where everyone who sold their possession or land was returned it without needing to pay anything to redeem it (Lev. 25:10-13). Likewise, those sold into slavery regained their freedom and returned to their family (Lev. 25:39-41)

## Significance

Returning to one's possession and being freed to return to one's family is typified by the New Testament age, where believers are returned to God as their lots divine possession, having been released from the bondage of sin and returning to God's house. The Lord Jesus proclaimed the reality of the Jubilee (Luke 4:18-19).
