### Righteousness

Matthew begins by telling us the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the Son of Abraham (Matt. 1:1). David was intentionally inserted before Abraham because he was the king of the OT. This shows that in order to receive the gospel, we need to experience Him as the king, the ruling of the king before we can experience the faith of Abraham. So soon after the beginning of the book, both John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus declared, *repent* for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near. This is concerning the matter of righteousness that we have not only sins but we have rebelled against God. That we need to repent for the kingdom's sake. The NT begins with such a book by God's sovereign arrangement not with the book of John which tells us "in the beginning there was the word... in Him was life...that we may receive Him." But here in the first book we are shown that we need to repent for God's kingdom sake.
