Ephesians 4:15-16 is the hardest passage in the Bible for believers to fulfill today. For *all* the Body to be joined together and knit together through the operation in the measure of *each* one part requires the rising up of the **entire church**. This is the only way the Body can grow and build itself up in love. It's not about the five-talented members like famous preachers and theologians who have recovered important truths, but that each one-talented member would operate according to their measure.
