## Background

## 1

God has blessed His people with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ. The phrase "to the praise of His glory" appears three times, once to conclude the blessing of the Father in verse 6, once to conclude the blessing of the Son in verse 12, and once to conclude the blessing of the Spirit in verse 14.

## 3

The Lord is homeless and He wants a place to dwell in (Eph. 3:17).

## 4

Verse 12 says that the gifts given to the saints in verse 8 would be used to perfect the saints for the work of building up the Body of Christ. This building is the growth of the Body, the addition of the life of Christ into the members.

Ephesians 4:15-16 is the hardest passage in the Bible for believers to fulfill today. For *all* the Body to be joined together and knit together through the operation in the measure of *each* one part requires the rising up of the **entire church**. This is the only way the Body can grow and build itself up in love. It's not about the five-talented members like famous preachers and theologians who have recovered important truths, but that each one-talented member would operate according to their measure. 

Verse 15 tells the believers to grow up into the Head, and verse 16 says "out from [the Head]". To grow into the Head is a believer's growth in life, and what issues out from the Head is the believer's function.

Verse 22 mentions the lust of *the* deceit. This indicates that deceit is a person, who is Satan himself.

## 5

The marriage life portrays the mystery of Christ and the church. In Genesis, God created animals for Adam to name to bring him into the same feeling that God had: there was no match. Thus, God built Eve out of Adam as God built the church out of Christ to be His counterpart. 

## 6

The conclusion of Ephesians touches the church as the corporate warrior. Intrinsically, this involves spiritual warfare. We are not those who are obsessed with spiritual warfare as our overall pursuit is toward Christ. However, understanding the relationship between spiritual warfare and God's economy allows us to better enter into it.

God has a will and a desire to carry out: His house as a dwelling place and His kingdom for His authority. Likewise, Satan has a kingdom in which he desires to reign. Spiritual warfare is the alignment of man's will to either God's or Satan's will. When we align our will to God's will, the enemy is terrified. This alignment requires [many things to be dealt with](../dealing).
