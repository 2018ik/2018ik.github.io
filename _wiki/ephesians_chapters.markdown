## Background

## 1

God has blessed His people with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ. The phrase "to the praise of His glory" appears three times, once to conclude the blessing of the Father in verse 6, once to conclude the blessing of the Son in verse 12, and once to conclude the blessing of the Spirit in verse 14.

Verse 12 says that the gifts given to the saints in verse 8 would be used to perfect the saints for the work of building up the Body of Christ.

Ephesians 4:15-16 is the hardest passage in the Bible for believers to fulfill today. For *all* the Body to be joined together and knit together through the operation in the measure of *each* one part requires the rising up of the **entire church**. This is the only way the Body can grow and build itself up in love. It's not about the five-talented members like famous preachers and theologians who have recovered important truths, but that each one-talented member would operate according to their measure. 

Verse 15 tells the believers to grow up into the Head, and verse 16 says "out from [the Head]". To grow into the Head is a believer's growth in life, and what issues out from the Head is the believer's function.

Verse 22 mentions the lust of *the* deceit. This indicates that deceit is a person, who is Satan himself.
