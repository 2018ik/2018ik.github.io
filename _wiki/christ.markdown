>"For to me, to live is Christ"

\- Phi. 1:21a

## Background

## Living

In order for us to express God, we cannot rely on our own life, but the divine life of Christ in resurrection (Col 3:4).

## Mystery 

Christ is the mystery of God. He is infinite, and became a finite man.

## In Christ

To be made in Christ (Eph. 1:11, 3:11) means that Christ existed simultaneously with God in eternity. The title Christ further indicates that Christ is the embodiment of God, and a commission to bring forth many sons of God so that God may have a household.
