>"For to me, to live is Christ"

\- Phi. 1:21a

## Background

**Christ** is the title given to the Son in His resurrection. Jesus refers to the name given to the Lord in His incarnation. Christ refers to the name given after His resurrection, when He became Lord and Christ. Jesus Christ highlights the fact of the man Jesus who once lived on earth that became this Christ while Christ Jesus highlights the reverse: that this divine One was once a man on the earth.

Ephesians 1:3 says "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ." God corresponds to Jesus while Father corresponds to Christ. In Christ's humanity - Jesus - God is His God. In His divinity, God is His Father. 

## Jesus Christ

The expression Jesus Christ refers to His humanity and highlights His person in incarnation.

In the Bible there is never an instance where believers are "in Jesus Christ" (there are instances of having faith/believing in Jesus Christ, but not being positionally "in"). There are only instances of being "in" Christ Jesus; entering into the processed Jesus.

## Christ Jesus

Christ Jesus emphasizes the one who received glory and honor by His resurrection was once a man. Christ Jesus refers more to His accomplishment and what He was able to gain and accomplish in God's will. 

## Living

In order for us to express God, we cannot rely on our own life, but the divine life of Christ in resurrection (Col 3:4).

## Mystery 

Christ is the mystery of God. He is infinite, and became a finite man.

## In Christ

To be made in Christ (Eph. 1:11, 3:11) means that Christ existed simultaneously with God in eternity. The title Christ further indicates that Christ is the embodiment of God, and a commission to bring forth many sons of God so that God may have a household.
