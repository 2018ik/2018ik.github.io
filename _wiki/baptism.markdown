## Background

**Baptism** is to bring a repentant person into the Triune God by terminating their old life and bringing them into eternal life as members of the Body of Christ with a spiritual and mystical union with the Head (Matt. 28:19; Rom. 6:3-4; 1 Cor. 12:13; Gal. 3:27). Baptism is physically through water, and spiritually through the Holy Spirit. Without the Holy Spirit, baptism by water is vain; without the visible aspect by water, the invisible aspect is abstract and impractical.

A proper baptism where one sees that they are immersed into the Person of the Triune God, into Christ as the life-giving Spirit, into the death of Christ, and into the Body of Christ, they will see that all differences in race, nationality, social rank and gender will no longer matter (Gal. 3:28). All believers are one when they are in Christ. 

## Prerequisites

The true baptism which John the Baptist speaks of as "in the Holy Spirit and fire" (Matt. 3:11) is only possible because Christ is the life-giving Spirit, and is *pneuma*. It would be impossible to be put into Christ and to put on Christ as in Galatians 3:27 if Christ had scended to the heavens and is merely sitting up there. Actually, as the pneumatic Christ, He is all around us, and we can put Christ on as the Spirit, which is the all-inclusive, processed and consummated Triune God. 

When someone is baptized, they should know the meaning of baptism. Without the proper appreciation, baptism is just a ritual and no different than a bath. If by the hearing of faith they realize that as they enter the water they are being immersed into the Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit to enter into an organic union, then they will have a living and real baptism.
