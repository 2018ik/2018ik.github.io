## Background

**Baptism** is to bring a repentant person into the Triune God by terminating their old life and bringing them into eternal life as members of the Body of Christ with a spiritual and mystical union with the Head (Matt. 28:19; Rom. 6:3-4; 1 Cor. 12:13; Gal. 3:27). This is an outward practice which follows the inward action of believing (Mark. 16:6). Entering into the water signifies terminating the old life by putting away the filth of the flesh while exiting signifies germinating the new life in the resurrection of Jesus Christ (1 Pet. 3:21). The reality of baptism is to be immersed in four invisible aspects: 

1. The name of the Triune God (Matt. 28:19)
2. Christ as the life-giving Spirit (Gal. 3:27)
3. The death of Christ (Rom. 6:3-4)
4. The Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:13)

Through baptism, all believers are one in Christ, and differences in race, nationality, social rank and gender  should be annulled (Gal. 3:28). Regrettably, many Christians continue to divide over the matter of baptism, debating over the method or what kind of water to use. Furthermore, some associate baptism primarily with outward signs such as speaking in tongues. Baptism is visibly through water, but much more significantly it is invisibly through the Holy Spirit. Without the Holy Spirit, baptism by water is vain; without the water, the invisible aspect is abstract and impractical.

## Prerequisites

The true baptism which John the Baptist speaks of as "in the Holy Spirit and fire" (Matt. 3:11) is only possible because Christ is the life-giving Spirit, and is *pneuma*. It would be impossible to be put into Christ and to put on Christ as in Galatians 3:27 if Christ had scended to the heavens and is merely sitting up there. Actually, as the pneumatic Christ, He is all around us, and we can put Christ on as the Spirit, which is the all-inclusive, processed and consummated Triune God. 

When someone is baptized, they should know the meaning of baptism. Without the proper appreciation, baptism is just a ritual and no different than a bath. If by the hearing of faith they realize that as they enter the water they are being immersed into the Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit to enter into an organic union, then they will have a living and real baptism.
