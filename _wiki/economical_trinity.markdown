## Background

The **economical Trinity** is the Trinity in action to fulfill His purpose in mankind. While in essence, the Trinity co-exists in Himself from eternity to eternity, God entered into time for a move. In the economical Trinity, God's three-ness is more prominent as the distinctions between the hypostases are manifest in action (e.g. Father plans, Son carries out, Spirit applies to man).

God having an economical aspect implies four things:

In His economy,
1. God can undergo change (1 Cor. 15:45)
2. God finds delight in man
3. God can coinhere with man to be a divine incorporation (John 14:20)
4. God can make man the same as He is in life and nature but not in the Godhead

Prior to entering into time as man, God was eternally perfect, complete but yet perfected, completed. He was yet to be processed, and did not have the human element.

## Significance

The economical aspect of the Trinity reconciles God's evident change (1 Cor. 15:45) and inter-operation between the Three (Matt. 3:16-17) with His essential oneness.

## Biblical Basis

1 Timothy 6:16, written long after the Lord's incarnation, death and resurrection says that God alone as immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, and that no man has seen Him nor can see Him. Without considering God in two aspects - essential and economical - this statement seems contradictory, as many people on earth saw the Lord Jesus who is God.

In John 7:39 Jesus spoke concerning the Spirit which was *not yet* because Jesus had not been glorified. This implies that a change must take place to glorify Jesus in order to consummate the Spirit. These changes occur economically, not essentially, as the essential God exists outside of time.

Economically, God the Father forsook God the Son of the cross. But essentially, there is no way the Father and Son can be separate. Therefore, Jesus was judged and died economically, but essentially, He was passing through death on the cross as the Triune God-man. 

Prior to the Son's ministry on earth, the economical trinity was not yet consummated (John 7:39). The consummated God refers to the fully processed Triune God.

## Examples

Below is a non-exhaustive list of the Divine Trinity in action and in experience.

### Matthew

| Verse | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1:20-23 | The Son was born of the Holy Spirit and was called Emmanuel, meaning God (the Father) with us. |
| 12:28 | The Son by the Spirit of God casted out demons that the kingdom of God would come, indicating that the Son's operation was neither by Himself nor for Himself, but by the Spirit and for the kingdom of God. | 
| 28:19 | Having been consummated through many processes, the name of the Divine Trinity is revealed for the first time. |

### Luke

| Verse | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1:35 | The Holy Spirit, the power of the Most High (the Father) and the Son of God were all involved in the conception of the Man-Savior. | 

## John

| Verse | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 14:6 | The Son is the way to the Father. |
| 14:7-13 | The Father and the Son coinhere and co-work, and the Son as the embodiment of the Father glorifies the Father. In short, we see a divine incorporation. |
| 14:16-20 | The mystery divine incorporation is realized by the Spirit. | 
| 14:21-23 | To love the Son is to love the Father, and to be loved by the Son is to be loved by the Father. |
| 14:26 | The Father sends the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, in the name of the Son. |
| 15:26 | The Son sends the Sprit from/with (*para*) the Father. While the Father sends in 14:26, the Son sends in 15:26. On one hand, the "two" sendings are distinct, on the other hand, they cannot be separate. This it the mystery of the Triune God. | 
| 16:13-15 | As the Son does not speak from Himself (John 14:10) so does the Spirit not speak from Himself. The Spirit glorifies the Son who glorifies the Father. What the Father has the Son has, and what the Son has is declared (made real) to us by the Spirit. |
