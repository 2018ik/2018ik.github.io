## Background

The **economical Trinity** is the Trinity in operation. While in essence, the Trinity of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit revealed in Matthew 28:19 has co-existed from eternity to eternity and is One, this Trinity entered into time for a move.

## Biblical Basis

In John 7:39 Jesus spoke concerning the Spirit which was *not yet* because Jesus had not been glorified. This implies that a change must take place to glorify Jesus in order to consummate the Spirit. These changes occur economically, not essentially, as the essential God exists outside of time.

Economically, God the Father forsook God the Son of the cross. But essentially, there is no way the Father and Son can be separate. Therefore, Jesus was judged and died economically, but essentially, He was passing through death on the cross as the Triune God-man.
