## Background

The **economical Trinity** refers to the Trinity in operation. While in essence, the Trinity of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit revealed in Matthew 28:19 has co-existed from eternity to eternity, this Trinity entered into time for a move.

## Biblical Basis

Economically, God the Father forsook God the Son of the cross. But essentially, there is no way the Father and Son can be separate. Therefore, Jesus was judged and died economically, but essentially, He was passing through death on the cross as the Triune God-man.
