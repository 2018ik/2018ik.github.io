## Background

The **economical Trinity** is the Trinity in action to fulfill His purpose in mankind. While in essence, the Three of the Trinity have co-existed in Himself from eternity to eternity and is One, God entered into time for a move. In the economical Trinity God's three-ness is more prominent (e.g. Father plans, Son carries out, Spirit applies to man). God having an economical aspect implies four things:

In His economy,
1. God can undergo change (1 Cor. 15:45)
2. God finds delight in man
3. God can coinhere with man to be a divine incorporation (John 14:20)
4. God can make man the same as He is in life and nature but not in the Godhead

Prior to entering into time as man, God was eternally perfect, complete but yet perfected, completed. He was yet to be processed, and did not have the human element.

## Significance



## Biblical Basis

1 Timothy 6:16, written long after the Lord's incarnation, death and resurrection says that God alone as immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, and that no man has seen Him nor can see Him. Without considering God in two aspects - essential and economical - this statement seems contradictory, as many people on earth saw the Lord Jesus who is God.

In John 7:39 Jesus spoke concerning the Spirit which was *not yet* because Jesus had not been glorified. This implies that a change must take place to glorify Jesus in order to consummate the Spirit. These changes occur economically, not essentially, as the essential God exists outside of time.

Economically, God the Father forsook God the Son of the cross. But essentially, there is no way the Father and Son can be separate. Therefore, Jesus was judged and died economically, but essentially, He was passing through death on the cross as the Triune God-man. 

## Consummated God

Prior to the Son's ministry on earth, the economical trinity was not yet consummated (John 7:39). The consummated God refers to the fully processed Triune God.
