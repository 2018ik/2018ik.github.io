## Background

**Rehoboam** was the son of Solomon and his successor as king. He was responsible for the division of Israel into two kingdoms.

## History

Rehoboam when asked about the very highly burdening tax on Israel went to the wise men, who said that if he treated the people well and removed the tax the people would serve him forever. Then, he went to his peers who flattered him all the time, who told the king to raise the tax. As a result, he raised the tax, and the kingdom became divided. The northern tribes went with Jeroboam who became the king of Israel, and Rehoboam only had 2 of the tribes as the southern kingdom of Judah.
