## Background

**Stones** are believers who are built up together into a spiritual house (1 Pet. 2:5). G

## Biblical Basis

In Matthew 16:18, the Lord said to Simon "you shall be called Cephas/Peter (*petros*)" which translated means stone. This is followed by "and upon this rock I will build my church." The Greek word for rock here *petra* indicates a large mass of rock. The Lord was indicating that Peter was a piece of a rock which when built up with other believers will become the church. As a result, it is unsurprising that Peter writes in His epistle that believers are living stones who are built up as a spiritual house (1 Pet. 2:5).
