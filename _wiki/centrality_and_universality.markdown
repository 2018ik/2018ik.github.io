## Background

Christ is the **centrality and universality** of God's economy. With regards to the centrality, He is head of the church, so He has preeminence over the church. He is also the head of each believer's being, thus He has the first place in each believer's life.

As the universality, He is everything in God's economy. Paul says to put on the new man, where Christ is all and in all. On one hand, Christ should be lifted up and exalted, and on the other hand, Christ should be every word that someone speaks, and everything that someone does. 

## Significance

Christ must be lived and magnified in every aspect of one's being, that He might be their center in all things.
