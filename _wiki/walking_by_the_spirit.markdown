## Background

**Walking by the Spirit** follows [living by the Spirit](../living_by_the_spirit) and has the sense of carrying things out. This is an inward walk by the Spirit, not an outward walk by spiritual signs and miracles.

## Daily Walk

The Greek word *peripateo* as in Galatians 5:16 is a habitual, daily walk. This includes life practices such as reading the Bible, praying, and calling on the Lord. The result of this walk is the fruit of the spirit in verses 22 and 23. Love, joy, peace, etc. are normal things that should be aspects of an ordinary daily life. This is the same walk in Romans 6:4, 8:4 and Philippians 3:17.

>...so also we might **walk** in newness of life.

>...who do not **walk** according to the flesh but according to the spirit

>...observe those who **thus** walk even as you have us as a pattern.

This is an ordinary walk according to something general, such as newness of life, the flesh, or "us." This can be likened to a person taking care of their daily affairs to sustain their living. Having this regular walk by the Spirit is the prerequisite for having the particular *stoicheo* walk, which can be likened to going to school and studying for a particular goal. Because many Christians lack a proper daily living, they are ill-equipped for the second walk to fulfill God's goal.

## Orderly Walk

The Greek word *stoicheo* (στοιχέω) in Galatians 5:25 is a march in military rank. This walk has a clear goal and is more regulated and builds on top of the first walk. A person has to take care of their daily needs before they can even consider pursuing a goal like getting a doctorate degree. To walk by the Spirit is in contrast to walking according to the law or some Christian standard. As the law purposely stipulates specific regulations which one must follow, the Spirit should also regulate us in specific ways for a goal. 

*Stoicheo* is also the word for "walk" in Romans 4:12,  Philippians 3:16, and Galatians 6:16:

>...but who also **walk** in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham."

Here, the walk is to conform to something specific, like the faith of Abraham or the rule he was talking about prior. 

>Nevertheless whereunto we have attained, by the same rule let us **walk.**

Based on the prior verses, this rule is to pursue toward the goal of laying hold of Christ (Phil. 3:12-14). 

>And as many as **walk** by this rule...

Walking according to the rule in Galatians 6:16 refers to the new creation being what matters; this is to walk according to the new creation which is in contrast to the natural life.

## Application

One should learn to walk by the Spirit in small matters first, say, how one talks or dresses. Then, the large matters will be settled organically.
