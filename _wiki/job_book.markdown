## Background

The book of Job reveals that man's concept regarding the perfection of human virtues and doing good for God is altogether against His intention, that is, for God to be dispensed into man to become his everything.

Many use the book of Job to teach philosophy, but God plainly says multiple times that Job's words were without knowledge (Job 34:35, 35:16). God's counsel concerning man is simple: he wants us to receive Him into us to be our everything, even to transform us into His image so that we can become His expression. The Christina perfection is for the expression of the Triune God not for the expression of our integrity of uprightness.

## Topics

### God's Word

Although all-scripture is God breathed (2 Tim. 3:16), not every word recorded in the Bible is necessarily God's speaking. For example, the serpent speaking in Genesis 3:1 is clearly not the word of God. Job was divinely inspired to write this book so that we can understand His economy.

### Purpose of Suffering

Job reveals that suffering is not necessarily the result of outward sin or punishment. God uses suffering caused by Satan to cause man to seek and gain God solely without any other blessings or prosperity, that man may be filled with God only, rather than man's perfection in uprightness and integrity.

### Tree of Knowledge

Job lived according to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. This can be confirmed by the fact that he wanted to debate with God, indicating that he lived by his self-righteousness. Everything that is of knowing good and evil apart from God Himself is actually of the wrong tree, and of death.

### Gaining God Himself

The record of Job is not to show that his patience or long-suffering resulted in being rewarded with greater prosperity (Job 42:10). Natural patience is also of the tree of knowledge. What Job realized is that he was good for nothing but death and burial. He repented of his self-righteousness before God (Job 42:6), to abhor himself and to realize that he was nothing. This is the intrinsic significance of baptism, and what Paul declares in Galatians 2:20, to die to the self to live to God. What Job gained through his ordeal was not further prosperity, but to see the God whom he had previously only heard of (Job 42:5)
