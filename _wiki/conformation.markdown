## Background

**Conformation** (Greek: *συμμορφή*) is to be molded into the image of the firstborn Son of God as the prototype for mass reproduction (Rom. 8:29). To be conformed is also to reach maturity in the divine life and participate in God's divinity in full and to be solidified in the possession of His divine element. In organic salvation, conformation is the consummation of transformation, and the prerequisite for the glorification of one's body.

The word "conform" is only used twice in the New Testament: Romans 8:29 and Philippians 3:10. In both cases, it is not used in the present progressive, but as an adjective and present participle respectively. While transformation emphasizes the process, conformation is the end result. Thus, while it is technically correct to say we are under the process of conformation, it is more accurate to say we are under the process of transformation.

The mold in which believers are conformed into is that of Christ's death (Phil 3:10). In order to be conformed to the resurrection of Christ, that is to receive His life to grow in life, we must first be conformed to His death (Rom. 6:5).

| Aspect | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Solidified in the possession of His divine element | One is regenerated with the divine life; conformation is the solidification of the possession of this life |
| Maturity in life | Conformation is related to maturing in the divine life; to be conformed implies fullness in the maturity in life. This is to be a full-grown man at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. |
| Consummation of transformation | When one is fully transformed in the divine life, they may participate in God's divinity in full and thus can be considered conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God. |
| Conformed to the image of the Firstborn Son of God | Rom. 8:29 |
| Conformed to the death of the Son | Phil. 3:10 |
| Preparation for the glorification of the body |  |

## Significance

## Biblical Basis

Ephesians 1:5 says that we were predestinated us unto sonship while Romans 8:29 says we were predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son. Actually, being conformed to the image of the Son is to reach full sonship (Rom. 8:17). Reaching full sonship is a matter of maturity in life.

Key verses:

>Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated *to be* conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers;

\-Rom. 8:29

>Whom we announce, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man full-grown in Christ;

\-Col. 1:28 

>Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ,

\-Eph. 4:13 

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>There was once a brother who had a strong natural life, and his wife had a terminal disease. But when praying for him, there was a strong sense that the prayer should not be for the wife's healing, but that the brother would be further conformed to the death of the firstborn Son of God. To those who love God, all things work together for us to be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God. When incredible, unimaginable and inexplicable things happen to us, we ned not murmur or reason against God  but we must worship and praise God that in our suffering we are being brought closer to the image of the Son of God.
