## Background

**Conformation** is to be molded into the image of the firstborn Son of God as the prototype for mass reproduction (Rom. 8:29). To be conformed is to reach maturity in the divine life and participate in God's divinity in full and to be solidified in the position of His divine element. This is the consummation of transformation, and the prerequisite for the glorification of one's body.

The mold in which believers are conformed into is that of Christ's death (Phil 3:10).
