## Background

**Conformation** is to be molded into the image of the firstborn Son of God as the prototype for mass reproduction (Rom. 8:29). To be conformed is also to reach maturity in the divine life and participate in God's divinity in full and to be solidified in the position of His divine element. In organic salvation, conformation is the consummation of transformation, and the prerequisite for the glorification of one's body.

The mold in which believers are conformed into is that of Christ's death (Phil 3:10). In order to be conformed to the resurrection of Christ, that is to receive His life to grow in life, we must first be conformed to His death (Rom. 6:5).

## Significance

## Biblical Basis

Ephesians 1:5 says that we were predestinated us unto sonship while Romans 8:29 says we were predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son. Actually, being conformed to the image of the Son is to reach full sonship (Rom. 8:17). Reaching full sonship is a matter of maturity in life.

Key verses:

>Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated *to be* conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers;

\-Rom. 8:29

>Whom we announce, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man full-grown in Christ;

\-Col. 1:28 

>Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ,

\-Eph. 4:13 

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>There was once a brother who had a strong natural life, and his wife had a terminal disease. But when praying for him, there was a strong sense that the prayer should not be for the wife's healing, but that the brother would be further conformed to the death of the firstborn Son of God. To those who love God, all things work together for us to be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God. When incredible, unimaginable and inexplicable things happen to us, we ned not murmur or reason against God  but we must worship and praise God that in our suffering we are being brought closer to the image of the Son of God.
