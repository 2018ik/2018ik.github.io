## Background

**Hosea** presents Jehovah as salvation to the adulterous and apostate Israel. This shows that regardless of how adulterous Israel is as the wife of Jehovah and how apostate Israel is as the people to Him, He still desires that she would return to Him.

### Cords of a Man

To draw Israel with cords of a man implies Christ in His incarnation. This is a love not on the level of His divinity but on the level of His humanity.
