## Background

## New Testament

In the Old Testament age, the temple was a physical building. The Lord dwelt in the physical building of the temple. In the New testament, the age of types was over, the age of fulfillment began. The Lord Jesus was the type of the tabernacle and temple of God. His goal and God's eternal purpose to enlarge the Lord Jesus as the individual house of God into the corporate house of God began.

When the Lord Jesus said to destroy the temple (John 2:19), the raising up of the temple was actually His resurrection. This implies that His physical body is weak and small, but His mystical resurrected body is vast and powerful. When we rise up from resurrection we do not ressurect alone, but with all my believers who constitute not only the members of the Body of Christ but living stones in God's building.

The word "three days" actually implies the entire church age. The Lord build up the entire body in His resurrection. In Romans 8:30 we were glorified. Didn't John see the New Jerusalem? With God there is no element of time, but only accomplishments. Nevertheless, what the Lord built up that is the Body of Christ needs to come into practical experience. Death cannot hold the resurrection life, death only gives it the opportunity to show its boundless invicible infinite power. Little did the devil now that when he destroyed the temple of the Lord's body that in the third day He would raise it up enlarging it into an organic mystical body. 

In 1942, Watchman Nee was excommunicated from the church in Shanghai, and he told others that he felt that his ministry would never resume again. But through the resurrection power he was brought back, and hundreds of churches were revived and raised up.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s there were ambitious coworkers who raised up dissension and rebellion among the churches in Taiwan. Brother Lee was led by the Lord to migrate to the U.S. to carry out the Lord's work, and the coworkers in Taiwan implored Lee to come back to deal with the rebellion. However Brother Lee said not to worry, as if the work he carried out is of men, it should be destroyed and must be destroyed. But if this work is of God, no one can destroy it. Eventually, the churches in Taiwan were brought into resurrection. Death cannot hold the resurrection life. If we hear of certain churches that are passing through a turmoil, we need to pray to bring those churches into resurrection. Bring them into the third day. 

In Christ's resurrection, He became a life-giving Spirit, which is the highest significance of resurrection. Did you realize that becoming a life-giving Spirit is also a work of Christ? We will realize one day that it is a work to become a husband, it is a marvelous work to become a Father, likewise to become a life-giving Spirit was indeed a glorious work.

In the New Testament, the reality of the temple is actually the human body, which is a temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 16:19-20).
