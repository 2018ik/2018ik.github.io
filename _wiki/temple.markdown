## Background

The **temple** in the Old Testament was an expansion of the tabernacle consisting of the same sections and furniture, and is a prefigure to the New Testament church. The reality of the temple is the tripartite man, which is a temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 6:19-20).

## New Testament

In the Old Testament age, the temple was a physical building. The Lord dwelt in the physical building of the temple. In the New testament, the age of types was over, the age of fulfillment began. The Lord Jesus was the type of the tabernacle and temple of God. His goal and God's eternal purpose to enlarge the Lord Jesus as the individual house of God into the corporate house of God began.

When the Lord Jesus said to destroy the temple (John 2:19), the raising up of the temple was actually His resurrection. This implies that His physical body is weak and small, but His mystical resurrected body is vast and powerful. When we rise up from resurrection we do not resurrect alone, but with all my believers who constitute not only the members of the Body of Christ but living stones in God's building.

The word "three days" actually implies the entire church age. The Lord build up the entire body in His resurrection. In Romans 8:30 we were glorified. Didn't John see the New Jerusalem? With God there is no element of time, but only accomplishments. Nevertheless, what the Lord built up that is the Body of Christ needs to come into practical experience. Death cannot hold the resurrection life, death only gives it the opportunity to show its boundless invincible infinite power. Little did the devil now that when he destroyed the temple of the Lord's body that in the third day He would raise it up enlarging it into an organic mystical body.
