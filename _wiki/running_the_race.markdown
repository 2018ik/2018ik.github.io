## Background

**Running the race** is to look and run towards the goal, that is to gain Christ to the fullest extent. The Christian life is a race to lay hold of the prize (1 Cor. 9:24). There is a "racecourse" prepared for each believer when they are generated to bring him on to full maturity (Heb. 6:1).

While initial judicial salvation is by faith and instantaneous, the Christian life is likened by Paul to a race. This is a process that one must go through to receive the overcoming reward. This is not salvation (Eph. 2:8; 1 Cor. 3:15), but the kingdom reward (Heb. 10:35; 1 Cor. 3:14). 

## Steps

To run the race, Paul said he buffeted his body and made it his slave (1 Cor. 9:27). "Buffet" here essentially means to beat up, but this is not asceticism, which Paul explicitly condemns (Col. 2:23), but to fully subdue the outer man, one's soul and body, that these members can be used God's purpose. 

It's also important to look towards the goal. To gain Christ to the fullest extent, one needs to forget the past and to not linger in past experiences (Phil. 3:13). Believers should be fully aware of this race, and be diligent in their seeking (Matt. 24:42-46).
