## Background

**Running the race** is an analogy used by Paul to describe the Christian life, which involves running the course towards the goal in order to receive a prize (1 Cor. 9:24). The course is the journey which God has ordained for each believer, the goal is the fulfillment of God's economy, and the prize is the kingdom reward. There is a "racecourse" prepared for each believer when they are regenerated to bring him on to full maturity (Heb. 6:1; 1 Cor 9:24-26; Phil. 3:12-14).

While initial judicial salvation is by faith and instantaneous, the Christian life is a race which takes time and endurance. This is to carry out the will which God has ordained, that is to carry out His economy. When one fulfill's God's will for them, they are able to receive the overcoming reward. This is not salvation (Eph. 2:8; 1 Cor. 3:15), but the kingdom reward (Heb. 10:35; 1 Cor. 3:14). This reward is seen in 2 Timothy 4:7 where Paul proclaims that he has finished the course in order to receive the crown of righteousness. 

## Steps

To run the race, Paul said he buffeted his body and made it his slave (1 Cor. 9:27). "Buffet" here essentially means to beat up, but this is not asceticism, which Paul explicitly condemns (Col. 2:23), but to fully subdue the outer man, one's soul and body, that these members can be used God's purpose. 

It's also important to look towards the goal. To gain Christ to the fullest extent, one needs to forget the past and to not linger in past experiences (Phil. 3:13). Believers should be fully aware of this race, and be diligent in their seeking (Matt. 24:42-46). The easiest way to look toward the goal is to look away unto Jesus who is the Author and Perfecter of our faith (Heb. 12:2).

## Course

A race is run on a course, of which there is only one - *the* course (2 Tim. 4:7). Yet, Paul also refers to *my* course as well as Timothy's course (Acts 20:24). Just like how there is only one ministry yet there are many ministers with their "own" ministry, God has set a personal race for each believer to run. Intrinsically, each course is the same and results in the carrying out of God's economy, but extrinsically they will differ.
