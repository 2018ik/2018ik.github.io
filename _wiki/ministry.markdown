## Background

**Ministry** is the carrying out of what God has covenanted with His people. The old covenant had a ministry according to the law, and the new covenant has a ministry according to grace. This one unique NT ministry is called the ministry of the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:6), the ministry of righteousness (2 Cor. 3:9), and the ministry of reconciliation (2 Cor. 5:18-20). Within the NT ministry, believers as ministers have a specific ministry, which is their specific function in the Body. This is why Paul could tell Timothy to "fully accomplish *your* ministry" (2 Tim. 4:5). Timothy was charged to fill up the full measure of his function in the Body. This is to do what has been measured out to him by God.

The NT ministry is composed of apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds/teachers who work to perfect the saints for the building up of the Body of Christ (Acts 13:1, Eph. 4:11-12) and is the Body in function. This ministry is not created by a human or organization process; ministers are gradually manifested by the Lord through their growth in life (Eph. 4:13). The ministry is not an individual matter; it is carried out in a corporate way. Furthermore, there is no ministry without prayer. Ministry is produced by revelation being burned into us through suffering. This is a Christ-ministering service; that is, the objective is to minister Christ.

## Relationship to the Churches and Work

The ministry is the functioning of the Body in service, while the "work" (as in Ephesians 4:12, sometimes colloquially called "move" e.g. the Lord's move in Europe) is the Body seeking increase. The churches are the expression of the Body in many localities. A local church does not carry out the work directly, but rather through ministers within the church. These three things (ministry, church, work) are not disparate things, in fact, normal Christians should identify with all three of these things: a minister who works to build up the church. The difference between the three can also be summarized in the following sentence:

**Ministers** are manifested, perhaps from an existing local church, who **work** to preach the gospel and build up more local **churches**, which eventually manifests in more ministers in these new churches who carry out the work.

## Leadership

The leadership of the New Testament ministry is the leadership of the controlling, God-given revelation of God's economy. We acknowledge the Watchman Nee and Witness Lee contributed much to the today's vision of the God's economy, but we are following the vision, not the person. While men are fallible and change, the vision of the age does not change.

We should also not work to attract people to follow us as people; we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord (2 Cor. 4:5). We should beware of the ambition to get a place or a district for our work, captivating people to be our private co-workers (1 Cor. 11:19).
