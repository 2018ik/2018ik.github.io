## Background

The ministry is composed of apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers (Acts 13:1, Eph. 4:11). It is the Body in function. The ministry is not created by a human or organization process, these ones were gradually manifested by the Lord through their growth in life (Eph. 4:13). Ministry is produced by revelation being burned into us through suffering. This is a Christ-ministering service; that is, the objective is to minister Christ.

Ministry is quite different from gifts and knowledge. The ministry is not an individual matter; it is carried out in a corporate way. 

## Cycle

The ministry is part of a cycle. Ministers are manifested, who work to preach the gospel and build up more local churches, which eventually manifests in more ministers in these new churches. Notice that these three things (ministry, churches, work) do not necessarily function as a cycle in all situations, as there are existing churches in which minsters can be sent to for the carrying out of the work.

## Leadership

The leadership of the New Testament ministry is the leadership of the controlling, God-given revelation of God's economy. We acknowledge the Watchman Nee and Witness Lee contributed much to the today's vision of the God's economy, but we are following the vision, not the person. While men are fallible and change, the vision of the age does not change.

We should also not work to attract people to follow us as people; we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord (2 Cor. 4:5). We should beware of the ambition to get a place or a district for our work, captivating people to be our private co-workers (1 Cor. 11:19).
