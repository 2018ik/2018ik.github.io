## Background

A **ministry** is to carry out what God has covenanted with His people. The old covenant had a particular ministry according to the law, and the new covenant has a ministry of the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:6). This one ministry is also called the ministry of righteousness (2 Cor. 3:9) and the ministry of reconciliation (2 Cor. 5:18-20)

The New Testament ministry is composed of apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds/teachers (Acts 13:1, Eph. 4:11) and is the Body in function. This ministry is not created by a human or organization process; ministers are gradually manifested by the Lord through their growth in life (Eph. 4:13). 

A person's ministry is their specific function in the Body which should correspond to the one ministry of God. Ministry is produced by revelation being burned into us through suffering. This is a Christ-ministering service; that is, the objective is to minister Christ.

The ministry is not an individual matter; it is carried out in a corporate way. Furthermore, there is no ministry without prayer. When Paul told Timothy to "fully accomplish your ministry" (2 Tim. 4:5) it means to fill up the full measure of your function in the Body. This is to do what has been measured out to him.

## Cycle

The ministry is part of a cycle. Ministers are manifested, who work to preach the gospel and build up more local churches, which eventually manifests in more ministers in these new churches. Notice that these three things (ministry, churches, work) do not necessarily function as a cycle in all situations, as there are existing churches in which minsters can be sent to for the carrying out of the work.

## Leadership

The leadership of the New Testament ministry is the leadership of the controlling, God-given revelation of God's economy. We acknowledge the Watchman Nee and Witness Lee contributed much to the today's vision of the God's economy, but we are following the vision, not the person. While men are fallible and change, the vision of the age does not change.

We should also not work to attract people to follow us as people; we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord (2 Cor. 4:5). We should beware of the ambition to get a place or a district for our work, captivating people to be our private co-workers (1 Cor. 11:19).
