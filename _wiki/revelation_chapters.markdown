## 14

There are three reapings in this chapter which show how God will deal with the Gentiles (the Jews/Israel were covered in Chapter 7). The first reaping is of the overcomers as firstfruits which occurs prior to the great tribulation (Rev. 14:1-6). Then there are the believers on earth who are ripened through the great tribulation (Rev. 14:15-16). Lastly, there are evil ones on the earth who are cast into the great winepress of the fury of God (Rev. 14:18-19).
