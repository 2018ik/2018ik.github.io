## Background

All believers have the **divine right** to partake of the tree of life (Rev. 22:14). Fallen human beings did not have the life of God, which is why Jesus came that they may have life (John 10:10). The Lord never explicitly stated that He came for the sake of redemption, but rather to give life. Through the process which He went through, all believers know have the right to participate in the following attributes of God's divinity:

| Attribute | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| Life | John 3:15; Col. 3:4 |
| Nature | Eph. 1:4; 2 Pet. 1:4 |
| Mind | Eph. 4:23; Phil. 2:5 |
| Being | 2 Cor. 3:18; Eph. 3:8 |
| Image | 2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29 |
| Glory | Rom. 8:30; Heb. 2:10 |
| Sonship | Eph. 1:5; Rom. 8:23 |
| Manifestation | Rom. 8:19 |
| Likeness | 1 John 3:2 |
| Species | John 1:12; Rom. 8:14-16 |
