### Christ, the Son

In Psalm 1, the psalmist blesses those who find delight in the law of Jehovah (Psa. 1:2). This is actually according to the Old Testament. However, in the Matthew 3 and 17, it is revealed that God only finds His delight in the Son. Therefore, Psalm 2 is the New Testament revelation which balances previous chapter. In Psalms 2, God installs His King upon Zion, who is the Son (Psa. 2:6-7), and the Psalmist says even to kiss the Son, and that blessed are those who take refuge in Him (Psa. 2:12). This is a much higher revelation than the previous chapter.
