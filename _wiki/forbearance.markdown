## Background

**Forbearance** is to be satisfied with less than one is due. This is proof that you are a great person. A small person loses their temper easily and is easily bothered by others, but a great person manifests forbearance in living with others. This is to the point of Matthew 5:44 where they love their enemies and pray for those who persecute them. This is a wonderful benefit one can enjoy when we make our home in Christ and He makes His home in us.
