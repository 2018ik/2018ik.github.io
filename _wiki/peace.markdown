## Background

**Peace** is the abolishment of enmity and reconciliation between parties as an issue of God's grace. Real peace is God Himself dispensed into man (Phil. 4:7, 9).

## The Church

>So then the church throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit

- Acts 9:31
