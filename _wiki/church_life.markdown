## Background

The **church life** is a procedure which practically carries out God's eternal economy by means of meeting according to the proper ground of oneness and locality. The Lord does not want mere individual believers but His church. The Lord's recovery is not only for the experience of Christ, but also the practical church life. In Matthew 16:18, the Lord Jesus says the gates of Hades will not prevail against the *church*.
