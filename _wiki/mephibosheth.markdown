## Background

Mephibosheth was the crippled grandson of King Saul (2 Sam. 4:4).

Saul and his household was being attacked, and as Mephibosheth fled, he fell and became crippled in his feet. However, King David showed kindness to him, and restored to him the land of his father and allowed in him to eat at the king's table (2 Sam. 9:7).

## Significance

Like Mephibosheth, each person in their natural self discovers that they are lame, and become discouraged. Instead, by looking away at the unsearchable riches of Christ on the Lord's table (signified by King David's kindness), one can enjoy the feast all the riches Christ has to offer. Furthermore, when eating, Mephibosheth's crippled feet are under the table and cannot be seen. Likewise, when one looks to Christ, they forget about everything else.
