## Background

The **face of Jesus Christ** as in 2 Corinthians 4:6 is His person which manifests all His inward thoughts and feelings. When one's heart is turned to the Lord, the veils are taken away, and they are able to behold the Lord and see the glory of God in His face. To see the Lord's face is equivalent to gaining Him; transformation is by beholding and reflecting the Lord, meaning that beholding the Lord causes us to gain Him and be constituted with Him (2 Cor. 3:18).



## Etymology

The Greek word translated as "face" also means *person*, and specifically refers to the part around the eyes. A person's face, especially their eyes, expresses their entire person.
