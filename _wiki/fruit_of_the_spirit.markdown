## Background

The **fruit of the Spirit** in Galatians 5:22 includes virtues such as love, joy, peace and long-suffering. *Fruit* implies that these virtues are an organic result of walking by the Spirit (Gal. 5:16). A plurality of virtues are included in the singular fruit of the Spirit, indicating that one does not need to concern themselves with these individual virtues but simply in walking by the Spirit. 

The preceding verses present a contrast to the fruit of the Spirit: the works of the flesh, including fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, and idolatry. The flesh opposes the Spirit, and is the only other way to walk besides the Spirit (Gal. 5:17). Thus, the only way to be saved from the sins of the flesh is to walk by the Spirit.

## Significance

The individual virtues of the fruit of the Spirit e.g. kindness, meekness, self-control are not meant to be attained to by our own effort. This would be to exercise the flesh to produce fruits of the Spirit, which is impossible. The fruit of the Spirit can only be produced by walking by the Spirit.
