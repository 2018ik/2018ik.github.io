## Background

The **surplus** is a portion of the produce from the Israelite's labor which they set aside for the purpose of worshipping God (Deut. 12:5-15). Each family had to labor in order to produce a portion to feed themselves for the purpose of sustaining life. However, they also produced a surplus not to feed themselves, but to come together in order to worship God in a corporate way. 

## Significance

The surplus as the corporate enjoyment of Christ means that when believers gather together in church meetings, they must bring the Christ whom they have labored on and experienced (Eph. 3:17-18; Col. 1:27). To come to a church meeting without the surplus is to come empty-handed; one cannot offer anything of worship to the Lord if they are empty-handed.
