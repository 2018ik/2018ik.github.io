## Background

The **pneumatic Christ** relates to Christ in His post-resurrection spiritual body in which He could enter the disciples as breath (John 20:22). The non-pneumatic, pre-resurrection Christ could not enter into anyone as breath. The Greek word *pneuma* means spirit, breath or air. 

To say Christ is pneumatic is to say that He is both full of and *is* the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17), which implies the pneumatic Christ in motion as breath.

Christ's breathing is the exhaling of Himself, which is also the believer's inhaling to take Him as their life and essence. His breathing never stops; this is for his continually unceasing dispensing with His people that they may be one with the Triune God.

## Significance

When one receives Christ as the Spirit, it is the pneumatic Christ, who is full of the divine breath. This is a picture of how every Christian should be: pneumatic and full of the divine breath.

This is in contrast with the law of letters in the Old Testament. In John 20, the Lord Jesus could have easily given His disciples a 300-page book of ordinances and rules to follow, or lectures on how to live. Instead, He simply breathed into them the breath of life.
