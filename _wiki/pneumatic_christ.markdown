## Background

The **pneumatic Christ** relates to Christ in His post-resurrection spiritual body in which He could enter the disciples as breath (John 20:22). The Greek word *pneuma* means spirit, breath or air. 

To say Christ is pneumatic is to say that He is full of the life-giving Spirit, which He breathes out to the believers.

## Significance

When one receives Christ as the Spirit, it is the pneumatic Christ, who is full of the divine breath. This is a picture of how every Christian should be: pneumatic and full of the divine breath.
