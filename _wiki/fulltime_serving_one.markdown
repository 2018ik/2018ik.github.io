## Background

A **Full-time serving one** refers to someone who drops their career to serve the Lord in a full-time capacity (although technically speaking, all believers as priests should serve the Lord 24/7, which is why these ones are sometimes qualified as "job-dropping full-time serving ones"). Full-time serving ones must live a life by faith trusting in the Lord for their necessities and receiving the Lord's supply through the saints nad the churches. If one feels led and burdened to serve the Lord full time they should not worry about their necessities; they have to believe in the Lor and put their trust in Him.
