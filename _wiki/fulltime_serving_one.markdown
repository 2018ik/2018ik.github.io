## Background

A **Full-time serving one** or **full-timer** usually refers to someone who drops their career to serve the Lord in a full-time capacity. Technically speaking however, a full-timer is someone who [lives to the Lord](../living_to_the_lord); whatever work they do, position they have and assets they own they do not consider their own, but the Lord's. This is why full-timer is sometimes qualified as "job-dropping full-timer" for clarification. Full-time serving ones must live a life by faith trusting in the Lord for their necessities and receiving the Lord's supply through the saints nad the churches. If one feels led and burdened to serve the Lord full time they should not worry about their necessities; they have to believe in the Lord and put their trust in Him.
