## Background

A **Full-time serving one** or **full-timer** usually refers to someone who drops their career to serve the Lord in a full-time capacity. Full-time serving ones must live a life by faith trusting in the Lord for their necessities and receiving the Lord's supply through the saints nad the churches. If one feels led and burdened to serve the Lord full time they should not worry about their necessities; they have to believe in the Lord and put their trust in Him.

More generally, a full-timer is someone who [lives to the Lord](../living_to_the_lord); whatever work they do, position they have and assets they own they do not consider their own, but the Lord's. This is why full-timer is sometimes qualified as "job-dropping full-timer" for clarification. On the other hand, there are "money-making full-timers" who support the job-dropping full-timers. To be full-timer according to this definition is insurmountably difficult for someone to accomplish in their natural life, it must be through God working through them.

## Basis

Paul charges the Romans to present their bodies a living sacrifice (Rom. 12:1).

## Purpose

Full-time serving ones are necessary to preach the gospel of the kingdom in the whole inhabited earth (Matt. 24:14). The many college campuses around the world are not going to have a flourishing work without ones willing to dedicate their full time. They must be knowledgeable in the truth, mature in the divine life, built up in their character and trained in how to present the truth.
