## Background

The **minor prophets** are placed at the end of the Old Testament and include Hosea to Malachi. These prophets have the same burden as the major prophets. 

Firstly, God continues to chastise Israel for their disobedience and evil, with the view not to destroy them but that they would turn back. This chastisement is through the nations; first the Babylonians, then the Medo-Persians, then the Greeks, and then the Romans. Secondly, God judges the nations as these nations are themselves also evil.

These books also prophesy concerning the manifestation of Christ (Mic. 5:2), and the restoration of all things.
