# Marriage

>Every brother wants to marry Miss America, but it's better to marry Betty Crocker. In the end, gravity will be the equalizer.

>Regardless of whether you pursue a career, drop your drop to serve full time, or go back to school, who you marry will have the greatest effect on the rest of your life.

>Pray for a brother/sister who loves the Lord more than you

# Career

>I see many young adults who have a one foot church life: one foot in the church and one foot in the world (especially their career)

# Fellowship

>We should be genuine and transparent, but also learn to season our speech with salt that it may not purvey death.

# Young People

>Arrange your schedule in this way: 7.5 hours for sleep, 1.5 hours for eating, 1 hour for exercise, 8 hours for study and 6 hours for spiritual things. If you expend your energy in this way, by the time you are thirty you will be able to begin your ministry like the Lord Jesus did.

# Migration

>Ask the Lord wherever you go to give you a saving companion.

>Don't go, be sent.

# Bible Study
