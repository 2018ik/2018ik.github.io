## Marriage

>Every brother wants to marry Miss America, but it's better to marry Betty Crocker. In the end, gravity will be the equalizer.

>Regardless of whether you pursue a career, drop your drop to serve full time, or go back to school, who you marry will have the greatest effect on the rest of your life.

>Pray for a brother/sister who loves the Lord more than you

## Career

>I see many young adults who have a one foot church life: one foot in the church and one foot in the world (especially their career)

## Fellowship

## Young People

>Arrange your schedule in this way: 7.5 hours for sleep, 1.5 hours for eating, 1 hour for exercise, 8 hours for study and 6 hours for spiritual things. If you expend your energy in this way, by the time you are thirty you will be able to begin your ministry like the Lord Jesus did.

## Migration

>Ask the Lord wherever you go to give you a saving companion.

>Don't go, be sent.

## Decisions

>We should ask two questions. Is this the Spirit? Is this for the Body?

## The Body of Christ

>If we truly see our position in the Body, it will be as though we were saved a second time.

>What I do not know, another member of the Body will know; what I cannot see, another member of the Body will see; what I cannot do, another member of the Body will do.

## Conduct

>Sometimes brothers are like locusts [in the home meetings], you hear buzzing and then all the food disappears.

>Don't correct, don't impose, don't suggest, just live Christ!

## Miscellaneous

>For the Lord to forgive us, and to cleanse us of our sins is not difficult. But for Him to break through the self to dispense Himself into that part of our heart is the greatest mountain.

>There's a big oven in the Lord's recovery and there's room in the oven for all of us.

>God doesn't want to do something for you, He wants to be something in you

## Love

>If you say that you love the Lord, yet year by year you remain the same, I do not believe you.
