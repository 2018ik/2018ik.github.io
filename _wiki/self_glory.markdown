## Background

To seek glory from men is a temptation to every Christian worker, and is an [inquity to God's work](../iniquity_of_the_sanctuary).

## Biblical Basis

Paul's gospel preaching only sought to please God, and did not seek glory from men, neither with flattering speech nor to fake holiness for self-gain (1 Thes. 2:4-6).

Anyone who seeks glory from men is a follower of Satan, who himself sought his own glory (Ezek. 28:17), and tempted Jesus to seek human glory (Matt. 4:8)
Saul also set up a monument for himself, which foreshadowed his downfall (1 Sam. 15:12).
