## Background

The **degradation** of the early church seeped in quickly due to the traditions of men, and the nature of man to do what is right in their own eyes. Unlike disparate failures, the degradation of the church cuts off the life source of the church. When the church cares so much about other things, such as non-biblical philosophies and rituals, they lose their appreciation and gaining of Christ, thus cutting off the source of life and becoming degraded. The reason why all of Paul's epistles were written were not only to edify the believers, but to admonish them to counteract the degradation of the church. 

## Causes

### Gnosticism

Gnosticism (Col. 2:8)

### Different teachings

These were teaching that were not the apostle's teaching (1 Timothy 6:3-5; Acts 2:42). Furthermore, churches would also turn away from Paul (2 Tim. 1:15).

### Greed

The desire for material gain (1 Timothy 6:5),

### Heresies

On one hand, there were different teachings which emphasized things beyond the central line, but others brought in of heresies (2 Tim. 2:16-18), which were completely against what the Bible says. This includes teachings such as denying God coming in the flesh (1 John 1:7) These heretics are described as "factious men" (Titus 3:10-11). These should be refused after a first and second admonition in order to maintain good order in the church.

### Hypocrisy

Having only the outward form of Godliness (2 Tim. 3:1-7).

### Ambition

Many in the early church wanted to be first, and elevated themselves above others (e.g. the Nicolaitans).

### Judaism

In Hebrews 10:25-29, Paul warns the Hebrew believers not to forsake the church for Judaism, that is to sin willfully (Heb. 10:26). To backslide to Judaism is to neglect God's New Testament salvation (Heb. 2:3) and to insult the Spirit of grace (Heb. 10:29)

### Losing the First Love

The church in Ephesus was degraded for losing its first love (Rev. 2:4).
