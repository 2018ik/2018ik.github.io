## Background

Blood cleanses sins; when God sees blood, He will pass over you (Exo 12:13).

## Blood of Christ

### Conscience

The blood is referred to over four hundred times in the Old and New Testaments, yet the Bible never once says that the blood is for cleansing the heart. Hebrews 9:14 does not say anything about cleansing the heart; it only speaks of cleansing the conscience. In the Bible the blood of Christ is for cleansing our conscience, not for cleansing our heart, because our heart embodies the self, the real I. The real I came from Adam and is by nature unclean. It can never be cleansed no matter how much it is washed.

The stony heart (Ezek. 11:19; 36:26) cannot become a heart of flesh no matter how much it is washed. What can we do? God says that the stony heart must be replaced with a heart of flesh. Hence, regeneration does not mean cleansing the old man, but doing away with the old man. One can never wash a statue of mud. The more we wash it, the dirtier it will become. The same is true with respect to our old man.
