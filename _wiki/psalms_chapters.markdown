## Background

## 23

Today, we are in Psalms 23 where we are shepherded in five stages:

>He makes me lie down in green pastures; / He leads me beside waters of rest (Psa. 23:2).

In the first stage, green pastures and waters of rest are the Lord Himself as the supply of life. Specifically, the green pastures are outside of the sheepfold representing religion (John 10:9) and Christ as the all-inclusive good  land. Waters of rest point specifically to the Spirit. 

>He restores my soul; / He guides me on the paths of righteousness / For His nameâ€™s sake (Psa. 23:3).

After feeding us, we enter the second stage, where we walk in the path of righteousness. Note that this comes *after* the supply in the first stage. Te restoration of the soul points to transformation.

>Even though I walk / Through the valley of the shadow of death, / I do not fear evil, / For You are with me; / Your rod and Your staff, / They comfort me (Psa. 23:4).

In the third stage, we see that something is not enjoyable - the valley of the shadow of death. This is the troubles and sufferings of life. Although the valley is unenjoyable, we find that the Lord comforts and sustains us. These situations are experiences of the cross, death and resurrection. In this stage, we learn to not fear evil. A tragedy may strike or an illness may come upon us; we are put into an environment that is challenging, oppressive and inordinately difficult.

>You spread a table before me / In the presence of my adversaries; / You anoint my head with oil; / My cup runs over (Psa. 23:5).

In the fourth stage, we are able to enjoy Christ despite the adversaries. We eat in front of Satan. We must experience and enjoy Christ in every time. This is a deeper and higher enjoyment of the resurrected Christ. Furthermore, we have the Triune God - the Son as the feast, the Spirit as the anointing oil and the Father as the cup which runs over, the source of blessing.

>Surely goodness and lovingkindness will follow me / All the days of my life, / And I will dwell in the house of Jehovah / For the length of my days (Psa 23:6).

In the fifth stage, there is the lifelong enjoyment of the goodness and lovingkindness of God. The house of Jehovah here is the house of God referring to the church today. To leave the church is to leave the protection of God's house. The personal experience of Christ in the prior four stages leads believers to the church for the Body life.

## 45

The psalmist's heart overflows concerning a good matter: the King who symbolizes Christ is brought into marriage with the daughter of Tyre who symbolizes the church as the bride of Christ.

## 73

The psalmist wondered why he was suffering so much while the worldly people were prospering. He could never understand why until he went into the sanctuary of God (Psalm 73:16-17). The answer is that God Himself is more valuable than temporal possessions on earth.

>Whom do I have in heaven but You? / And besides You there is nothing I desire on earth. / My flesh and my heart fail, / But God is the rock of my heart and my portion forever.

\-Psalm 73:25-26

## Psalm 110

This chapter has one of the highest revelations of Christ in the Bible. These verses have been quoted directly more than twenty times in the NT, and twenty more times indirectly. The highest place in the universe is at the right hand of God, where the Lord is now.
