## Background

## 23

God shepherds in five stages:

>He makes me lie down in green pastures; / He leads me beside waters of rest (Psa. 23:2).

In the first stage, green pastures and waters of rest are the Lord Himself as the supply of life. Furthermore, the green pastures are outside of the sheepfold representing religion (John 10:9).

>He restores my soul; / He guides me on the paths of righteousness / For His nameâ€™s sake (Psa. 23:3).

In the second stage, we walk in the path of righteousness. Note that this comes *after* the supply in the first stage. 

>Even though I walk / Through the valley of the shadow of death, / I do not fear evil, / For You are with me; / Your rod and Your staff, / They comfort me (Psa. 23:4).

In the third stage, we see that something is not enjoyable - the valley of the shadow of death. This is the troubles and sufferings of life. Although the valley is unenjoyable, we find that the Lord comforts and sustains us. These situations are experiences of the cross, death and resurrection.

>You spread a table before me / In the presence of my adversaries; / You anoint my head with oil; / My cup runs over (Psa. 23:5).

In the fourth stage, we are able to enjoy Christ despite the adversaries.

>Surely goodness and lovingkindness will follow me / All the days of my life, / And I will dwell in the house of Jehovah / For the length of my days (Psa 23:6).

In the fifth stage, house of Jehovah here is the house of God referring to the church today. The personal experience of Christ in the prior four stages leads believers to the church for the Body life.
