## Background

The first laugh signifies that which one cannot do, and the second laugh signifies that which God can do. Sarah laughed when God said she would have a son at 90 years old (Gen. 18:15). This was the first laugh; this was an impossible requirement from her natural perspective. Then, she conceived and bore Isaac, meaning laughter (Gen. 21:2-3). This was the second laugh which resulted from God making the impossible possible.
