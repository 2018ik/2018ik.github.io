## Background

**Regulation** refers to the [law](../law_romans) of a particular life governing over the growth and operation of that life to manifest its innate characteristics regardless of external factors. Law in this context is the spontaneous, automatic regulating power of a life to bring forth the riches of that life. For example, the law of a peach tree's life regulates it to grow like a peach tree and produce peaches. Likewise, the law of the divine life within us regulates us to grow in a certain way and to do certain things.

## Responsibility

Although the regulation is spontaneous, it is dependent on the environment in which the lifeform is placed. For example, if a seed is kept on a table, it has no chance to grow and no opportunity for the law of its life to regulate. However if placed into the earth and watered, the life will regulate it to grow. Likewise, the regulation of the law of life in Romans 8:2 only functions when we yield to it and give it the opportunity to work. If we are always working in our self effort, then there is no opportunity for the law of life to regulate.

For example, someone may loe the Lord very much, but the more they love the Lord, the more they do. There was once a sister who gave up her family, husband and children and worked tirelessly for the Lord from early in the morning to late at night. When she came to the meetings, she would be so tired from working tht she was fall asleep. It was difficult for others to help her because she thought she loved the Lord the most.

Actually, her love although great was natural. When one loves the Lord, they should stop, and cooperate with the divine law of life that will expand from the spirit into he mind, emotion and will that will cause us to love the Lord with the pure love of God.
