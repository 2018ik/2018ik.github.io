## Background

**Regulation** refers to the [law](../law_romans) of a particular life governing over the growth and operation of that life to manifest its innate characteristics regardless of external factors. Law in this context is the spontaneous, automatic regulating power of a life to bring forth the riches of that life. For example, the law of a peach tree's life regulates it to grow like a peach tree and produce peaches. Likewise, the law of the divine life within us regulates us to grow in a certain way and to do certain things. 

Regulation kills our opinions.
