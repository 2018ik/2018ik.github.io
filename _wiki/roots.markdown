## Background

The **roots** of a plant are what grounds it into the soil so that it would not be scorched by the sun (Mark. 4:16-17) but rather grow by absorbing the nutrients of the soil which is the all-inclusive Christ (Isa 37:31; Jer. 17:7-8). 

## Significance

Plants are healthy when they have a deep root system. We need to have many private interactions with Christ that are not seen; this is why the Lord tells His disciples to enter into their private room and to pray in secret.
