## Background

To quench the Spirit (1 Thes. 5:19) is to ignore the leading of the Spirit. God is always seeking to operate in His believers. 

In one's daily living, they can participate in many things which are not inherently sinful, such as shopping, going to the movies, and wearing certain clothes. When there is a feeling in one's conscience or intuition regarding something, such as to not watch a particular movie, one has the free will to choose what to do. However, to ignore this feeling is to quench the Spirit.

## Biblical Basis

Romans 12:11 says to be burning in spirit and 2 Timothy 1:6 says to fan into flame the gift of God. To quench the Spirit is to therefore put out these flames, therefore becoming cold (Matt. 25:12) or lukewarm towards God (Rev. 3:16).
