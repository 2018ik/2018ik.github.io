## Background

The intuition enables one to have a direct sense from God, and is a function of the human spirit.

## Biblical Basis

### The Spirit

To show that the intuition is a function of the spirit, the Bible reveals that the spirit can also know or sense things.

1 Corinthians 2:11 reveals that the spirit of man can know what the soul cannot, indicating that an extra discernment is in our spirit. Our soul can know things by facts and logic, but the human spirit can discern things without these. This direct sense shows that the intuition is in our spirit. 

Mark 2:8 says "Knowing fully in His spirit." The knowing of the spirit is a different knowing then that of the mind, which is beyond natural human understanding. This is the intuition of our human spirit.
