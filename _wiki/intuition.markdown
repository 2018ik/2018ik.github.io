## Background

The **intuition** is the direct sense in one's spirit of God's mind, emotion and will. This could be to know God's opinion (1 Cor. 7:40), whether or not God is pleased, and what He wants to do.

## Significance

The intuition is not something superstitious, or supernatural e.g. a premonition of winning lottery numbers. The intuition is for us to sense something from God through our fellowship of His will. 

## Biblical Basis

### The Spirit

To show that the intuition is a function of the spirit, the Bible reveals that the spirit can also know or sense things.

1 Corinthians 2:11 reveals that the spirit of man can know what the soul cannot, indicating that an extra discernment is in our spirit. Our soul can know things by facts and logic, but the human spirit can discern things without these. This direct sense shows that the intuition is in our spirit. 

Mark 2:8 says "Knowing fully in His spirit." The knowing of the spirit is a different knowing than that of the mind, as it is beyond natural human understanding. This is the intuition of our human spirit.

## Relationship to the Mind

The sense from the intuition of the spirit is interpreted and understood by the mind. This leading of the spirit can be exercised and developed. By continually following the sense of the spirit, one will become more sensitive to the leading, and therefore gain a keener intuition.
