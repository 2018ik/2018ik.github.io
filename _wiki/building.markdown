## Background

God's work is a **building** work; He is building Himself into man and man into Himself. With God's creation there is nothing of god Himself in His creatures. In His building God works with Himself as the material. Therefore, God's building is is a divine mingling of God Himself with man as His creature.

## Biblical Basis

In fact, the entire scripture is about life and *building*. In the beginning of the Bible, Eve, typifying the church, was *built* out of the Adam's rib. In the end of the Bible there is the New Jerusalem, the consummation of all prior building work.

## Process

### Material

The material with which we build with must be gold, silver and precious stones, as opposed to wood, grass and stubble (1 Cor. 3:12).

The only material which we can build with is Christ. So Christ must be in us.
