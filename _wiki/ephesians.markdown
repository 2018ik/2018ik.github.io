## Background

## Subject

The main subject of the book of Ephesians is the church in seven aspects:

| Aspect | Description |
| --- | --- |
| The Body of Christ | The expression of Christ with a measurable stature |
| The new man | The life and person of Christ |
| The kingdom of God | Having rights and responsibilities |
| The household of God | A family with life and enjoyment |
| The dwelling place of God | For God to live in |
| The bride and wife of Christ | For Christ's rest and satisfaction |
| The warrior | To defeat the enemy to accomplish God's purpose | 

*\*For all 11 aspects, see church*

## Topics

### Trinity

Paul structures His arguments with the Trinity in view. Ephesians 1:3 says that the Father blessed us *in Christ*. 2:18 says that we have access in on Spirit unto the Father. 3:11 says that the Father made His eternal purpose in Christ Jesus. The entire Trinity is seen in the prayer from 3:14-19. 

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>If you ask someone what is the meaning of the book of Ephesians, some may say according to chapter 2, by grace we are saved. Or perhaps in Ephesians 5, that wives should be subject to their husbands. To them, that is the heart of Ephesians. Some parents may love chapter 6 - children should obey their parents in all things. Children, don't vex your parents! Well, all these verses are not the basic structure of the book of Ephesians.

>The intrinsic content of the book of Ephesians in the Triune God dispensed into the believers for the producing and building up of the Body of Christ. We need to pray to see the Triune God in every page of the Bible. The Bible is full of "God said," but did you realize that every time this is written, the Triune God is involved? God only speaks one kind of languages - that is the Son! Hebrews 1:2 reveals that God has spoken to us in the Son! The Spirit is also the breath of God. The Father is the speaker, the Son is the word, and the Spirit is the breath.
