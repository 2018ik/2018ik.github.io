"And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication."

\- Rev. 17:4

## Background

The Roman Catholic Church is portrayed in the Bible as a religion of idol worship, and a mixture of paganism into Christianity.

## Biblical Basis

The woman in Revelation 17:4 refers to the Roman Catholic Church. In the Roman Catholic Church there is purple and scarlet in every corner. The cardinals’ robes are scarlet. The Catholic Church is full of precious stones, gold, and silver. The pope has two crowns, one representing his religious power and the other his secular power. Both crowns are made of gold. The one that represents his secular power has one hundred forty-six large diamonds, five hundred forty pearls, and seven levels of gold.

Furthermore, the golden cup was full of abominations, which refer to the idols. Deuteronomy 7:25-26, Daniel 9:27, 2 Chronicles 33:2, and Ezekiel 20:7-8 all say that idols are abominations. Outwardly the cup is golden, seemingly divine, as gold signifies the divine nature. Yet this cup is filled with abominations. 

## Practices

### Mary Worship

The Catholic Church worships Mary because all other world religions have goddesses. Christianity is the only religion that does not have a goddess. Roman Catholicism brought in the idea of a “goddess” from paganism. It created Mary as a “goddess” and teaches men to worship her. We have to know this fact and have to help new ones understand that idolatry is an abomination in the eyes of God. A Christian cannot defile himself with any kind of idolatry. 

Mary began to be exalted in the fifth century. The title “mother of God” was applied to Mary at the time of the Council of Ephesus in A.D. 431. There is a book called The Glories of Mary, written by a bishop called Alphonsus Maria De Liguori, in which he describes in detail how the Catholic Church exalts and worships Mary. Part I, Chapter VI, Section III of that book says that “Mary is the Peace-maker between Sinners and God.” Chapter II, Section I says “Mary is our Life, because she obtains for us the Pardon of our Sins.” Chapter V, Section I speaks of “The Necessity of the Intercession of Mary for Our Salvation.”

Luke 1:46-47 states "And Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord, And my spirit has exulted in God my Savior" which clearly states that she needed the Lord Jesus just as we do. Her soul magnifies the Lord. 

### Marriage

When a Roman Catholic marries someone who is not Roman Catholic, the church will permit it, under one condition: the children must also be Roman Catholic, and a vow must be made accordingly. This is one of the reasons why Roman Catholicism is so prevailing: the children are a big factor and the fruit for the going on of any institution.
