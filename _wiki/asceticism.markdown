## Background

Asceticism can be seen in various human ordinances which result in severe treatment of the body. typically limitations in handling, tasting and touching (Col. 2:21). Practicing asceticism actually has no value against restraining the indulgences of the flesh (Col. 2:23). This is related to the legality of ordinances and to Judaistic observances, which only serve to carry us away from Christ (Col. 2:8).
