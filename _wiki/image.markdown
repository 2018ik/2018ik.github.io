## Background

The **image of God** as in Colossians 1:15 refers to the fullness of God, who is Christ. Since God is invisible, in order for Him to express Himself He needs a visible image. This image is Christ. John 1:18 says that no one has ever seen God, but the Son has *declared* the Father. The Son declares the Father by being who and what He is. This why the Lord is able to say "He who has seen Me has seen the Father" (John 14:9).
