## Background

**Dealing with the spirit** is to purify one's spirit from any defilement as it passes through the soul and body such that one can minister Christ. While this depends on dealing with sins, flesh, self, conscience and world, it is deeper and finer than dealing with the soul and body generally. All of a person's motives, intentions and thoughts must be dealt with specifically. The dealing with the spirit is equivalent to the breaking of the outer man for the pure release of the spirit, the inner man.

## Application

To deal with the spirit, we have to:

1. Be willing for the Lord to deal with our spirit. 
2. Come to the Lord. Don't go dig around for the mixture.
3. Be properly aggressive, taking the initiative to condemn any and all mixture the Lord exposes. Don't try to justify it.
4. Purge out the mixture from within by the power of the Holy Spirit, applying the cross of Christ to the inner being.
5.

### Testimony #1

>Suppose you speak something concerning a matter with the release fo your spirit but with an impure motive. Say you do it to get praise from others. When you do this, your conscience judges and condemns you for speaking impurely. We've all done this, we speak something during the meeting but our conscience wasn't comfortable. So we go to the Lord and we deal with our conscience by saying "amen" to the enlightening that you receive, causing the blood to be applied to you and deals with your speaking before God. He's forgotten it, it's gone. And if the Lord would lead, you may need to clear it up to those you've spoken to. But once this is dealt with you have peace to continue enjoying the Lod. But even though you dealt with your conscience, the impurity itself within you hasn't been dealt with. because fo this the next time you get up to speak about this matter and you release your spirit again, what's gong to happen? The same impurity will come forth, mixed with your spirit as its flowed out. We must cooperate with the Lord not merely to do with our speaking but with our motive.

>Similarly, after you interact with a certain brother or sister you might have a negative or critical view of them, that is, a critical spirit towards them. This spirit is impure; the Lord has no critical spirit, but you do. Even though you don't say anything, you're conscience still enlightens you and condemns you. To agree with the light, the blood is applied and you are brought back into peace to continue enjoying the Lord. But the next time the person is mentioned, and you don't even see them, that critical spirit toward them rises again in you.
