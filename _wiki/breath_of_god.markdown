## Background

Throughout the Bible, God breathes out His breath, the **breath of God**, which primarily refers to the Holy Spirit (John 20:22) and the word of God (2 Tim. 3:16). The Old Testament also relates God’s breath of life to man’s spirit (Gen. 2:7; Prov. 20:27; Job 32:8).

## Significance


## Word of God

Second Timothy 3:16 says that all Scripture is God-breathed. Since speaking words requires breathing out, it is no surprise that the Scripture, which is God’s words, is connected to His breath. Since God’s breath is the Spirit and the Spirit gives life, God’s goal in us reading the Bible is to receive life (John 6:63).
