## Background

**Character** refers to the intrinsic qualities of one's being that determines their usefulness, the responsibilities they can bear, and the things they can accomplish. On the other hand, a person's **living** is the extrinsic living out of their character. The totality of these two terms can be described as a person's "person." The key idea here is that God pays more attention to what kind of person someone is than what they can accomplish, as the former is a prerequisite of the latter. In a sense, in God's economy, the person *is* the work. The condition of a vessel is often used as a metaphor for one's character. As vessels made to contain God, we fail our basic function of containing God if we have a problematic character (i.e. a cracked, weak, or leaking vessel). 

The living of God's people should be different from the common living; this includes how one behaves in their work life, church life and family life. To be a Christian, one must not only know God and His word, but also one's person.

## Significance

It is not enough to be competent in performing many tasks; the proper Christian living is one which lives out Christ daily, not only during the church meetings. How one conducts themselves in their daily living has a significant impact on their testimony towards their family (especially the children), friends and coworkers. Furthermore, those with a good character can be used by God to carry out many things. There is no difference between the Holy Spirit that each person receives; however, the degree to which that Spirit can penetrate one's being is a matter of character. 

There are many commonly used analogies for the importance of character:

| Analogy | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Vessel | Vessels can be made of wood, stone, or gold. And the condition of the vessel can be clean, dirty, chipped, cracked, etc. Furthermore the vessel may be tall, short, wide, or narrow. The characteristics of this vessel determines how well it will be able to hold water. There is no problem with the water (representing God) but the container may be unable to properly hold God. |
| Soil | The condition of soil determines how well a seed will grow in it. |
| Fabric | The condition of the fabric determines how good the dye will look on it. |

## Biblical Basis

Matthew 17:7-12 teaches that a good tree produces good fruit and that a corrupt tree produces bad fruit. A good tree inherently produces good fruit; it is the proper source which brings forth the proper results. Likewise, a proper minister will spontaneously result in a good ministry. It is senseless to try to work out a good ministry without first taking care of the person.

Abraham, Moses and Paul all had an excellent character. In Acts, the elders which were appointed were 7 well-attested men. These were reliable men of good character.

## Practical Basis

If one is able to do much (i.e. speak eloquently, have much knowledge and life experience) but has a bad character, they will be unable to be useful to the Lord. For example, new ones are always listening to the things mature ones say and do, even the small things. If the leading ones are sloppy and rude off-hours, what kind of testimony would that give to those observing? It would lessen the value of *all* of their words.

The Christian life is a life of sowing; everything one does is a kind of sowing, either of the flesh or the spirit (Gal. 6:7-8). That is, what one does in their daily living is also a pattern that the younger ones follow (2 Tim 3:10). A dissolute life establishes a bad standard which others - especially one's children - will follow.

### Examples

On Lord's day (Sunday), believers should go to the Lord's day meeting, because it is the proper testimony of a Christian. Nowadays, Sunday morning seems to be the only available time for things to be done - sports, birthday parties, etc. As ones who belong to God, believers must have a particular living, including during the Lord's day morning. At work, all kinds of social events occur, but our coworkers need to realize that if there is something with the church, we are not available. Eventually, they will understand and respect such decisions, to be true to one's conviction and faith. 

## Building Character

Character building is easier the younger a person is. Children should be built up in their character so that they will be useful to the Lord when they are older.
