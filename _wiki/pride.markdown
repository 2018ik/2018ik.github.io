## Background

**Pride** is to think more highly of oneself than others and has been and will continue to be the number one reason for division throughout church history (Rom. 12:3). Satan sought to exalt Himself and was humbled by God, being cast out of heaven (Isa. 14:12-15). The Lord Jesus humbled Himself and was exalted to the right hand of God.
