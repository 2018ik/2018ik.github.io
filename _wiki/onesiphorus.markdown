## Background

**Onesiphorus** was a friend of Paul who remained faithful to Paul and to the Lord. In 2 Timothy 1:16-17, Onesiphorus refreshed Paul and was not ashamed of his chain, even seeking Paul out diligently when he was in Rome.

## Significance

Onesiphorus is mentioned alongside two dissenters - Phygelus and Hermogenes - during a time when all in Asia hda turned away from Paul (2 Tim. 1:15). To be an "Onesiphorus" in today's age of decline is to be a an overcomer who stands firm against the downward current.
