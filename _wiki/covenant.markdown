## Background

A **covenant** is an agreement between two parties containing promises to accomplish certain things.

In Greek, the same word is used for both covenant and testament. A covenant and a testament are the same, but when the maker of the covenant is living, it is a covenant, and when he has died, it is a testament. A testament in today's terms is a will. A covenant is an agreement containing promises to accomplish certain things for the covenanted people, while a testament is a will containing a accomplished things that are bequeathed to the inheritor.

## New Covenant

Through His death, Christ fulfilled the demands of God's righteousness according to the law (the old covenant) and enacted the new covenant (Rom 3:21; 10:3-4; Luke 22:20; Heb. 9:16-17). According to the law, the wages of sin is death, therefore the Lord had to die in order to fulfill its requirements (Rom. 6:23). In His resurrection, He became the new covenant with all its bequests (1 Cor. 15:45; Isa. 42:6; Phil. 1:19). 

As the new covenant, Christ contains God's salvation, blessings and all of His riches, which has been given to the believers as a bountiful supply (Phil. 1:19). The way that believers can experience the contents of the new covenant is through Christ as the life-giving Spirit (Gal. 3:14). 

The bequests of the new covenant are contained in the human spirit. By the law of the Spirit of life, these bequests are dispensed into us and made real to us (Rom 8:2). Our spirit as a divine bank account contains far more riches than even the monetarily richest people on earth. What could surpass perfect peace and full satisfaction?
