## Background

Restrictions expose our shortness. We are unable to abide with restrictions in our natural self. However, we should not stay in our shortness, neither should we dismiss our shortness. 

Restrictions are closely related to the law, which also allows us to see the sinfulness of our natural condition.

## God's New Testament Economy

God's New Testament economy is focused on Christ and the experience of Christ. 

We must first confess our disobedience, and then touch the one who *is* obedient - Christ Jesus. The living Christ is obedient onto death; His obedience can become our obedience.

God's New Testament Economy is grace. When we are subject to restrictions, we can simply turn to Christ. In fact, that is all we should do, and all we *can* do. In this way, we can receive grace.
