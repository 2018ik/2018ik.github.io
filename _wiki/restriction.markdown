## Background

**Restriction** is inwardly the spirit's constraining which limits a Christian's freedom, and outwardly is environments God places His people in order to transform them. 

## Inward Restriction

The inward restricting of the spirit is directly correlated with the flow of life. The deeper the flow, the more one is carried along by the flow. When the flow of water is not so deep, someone can easily walk around and move how they want. When the water deepens, it becomes slightly more difficult. When the water becomes deep enough to swim in, and the current is flowing a particular direction, we lose our personal freedom (Ezek. 47:4-6). We have no choice but to follow the flow in all things, even the way we style our hair!

## Outward Restriction

Restrictions expose our shortness. We are unable to abide with restrictions in our natural self. However, we should not stay in our shortness, neither should we dismiss our shortness. Restrictions are closely related to the law, which also allows us to see the sinfulness of our natural condition.

## God's New Testament Economy

God's New Testament economy is focused on Christ and the experience of Christ. 

We must first confess our disobedience, and then touch the one who *is* obedient - Christ Jesus. The living Christ is obedient onto death; His obedience can become our obedience.

God's New Testament Economy is grace. When we are subject to restrictions, we can simply turn to Christ. In fact, that is all we should do, and all we *can* do. In this way, we can receive grace.
