>"But you, beloved, building up yourselves upon your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit"

\- Jude 20

## Background

**Prayer** is to contact God in the spirit to absorb God, which is to have fellowship with God. Prayer should be the believers' response to God's flowing in, and their flowing back to God. Prayer should be a living, unceasingly talking to God throughout the day (Eph. 6:18), but specific times should also be set aside for praying in private (Matt. 14:23; Mark 1:35; Luke 5:16).

Prayer may start in the self, but with the proper yearning and turning, one can contact God which brings them into a bilaterally active touch with Him where they enter into Him as the Spirit in their spirit. As a result, this prayer is also truly what is on God's heart, and all such prayers will be answered (John 15:7).

First, one must recognize that God has a will. If God reveals His will to someone, they should pray this will back to Him and He has a way to move through that. God's ways and thoughts are higher than man's (Isa. 55:8-9).

Through our prayer God passes through our being, and we pass through His being. Our words pass though Him and His words pass through Us and two pray together one prayer. Often the first word of our prayer is of the mind, but by the end, it is altogether of the spirit.

Prayers should be divine facts, for example what the Lord prayed in John 17. Praying for one's need is okay, but it should be prayed in a divine way. 

The reason why we have little experience of this is we haven't paid specific attention to our contact with Him, and through our fellowship with Him fail to bring him into our present frame with us and to hold him there. It it through such a fellowship that we are brought into his being and we can pray in Him and he can pray in us; two are praying together. The simplest way do do this is to call.

## Significance

To pray is to realize that the self is nothing and can do nothing; prayer is the real denial and repudiating of one's self so that one may enjoy Christ as their everything (Col. 4:2; Gal. 2:20).

## Biblical Examples

### Hannah

For years Hannah prayed to have a son, but it was not until she touched the Lord's burden that she became pregnant (1 Sam. 1:11).  

### Samuel

### David

David many times inquired of God for what to do (1 Sam. 23:2, 4). 

### Daniel

Daniel had particular times throughout the day to pray.

### Jesus

## Principle of Prayer

Firstly, we must pray before God will rise up to work (Matt 18:18-20). God will not act independently, we must pray and agree with Him - His goal is to accomplish His will through our prayer.

This brings us to the second point: prayer is our working together with God to accomplish His will. If we do not work together with God in prayer for His will, He will not work and cannot work. This is why He won't give you infinite Lamborghinis, even if you pray and ask for it.

We must see this principle: while God cannot do what he wants to do unless man wants it, he likewise will only carry out His will when our prayers are in harmony with His will.

And lastly - for the carrying out of God's economy, it is necessary that we have a corporate prayer of the Church. 

## Dispensing

The dispensing in God's economy is conditional, and that is based on our prayer. In a sense, our prayer is our "yes" to Him. 

### Passport application

The Lord has applied for a passport to enter into us. Our prayer is the stamp on this passport which allows Him to pass through into us.

## Inhaling

Inhaling implies taking in a gas, and bringing it into us that it may be absorbed. When we pray, God as the divine air is able to move into our inner being unimpeded as if we are breathing Him in.

## Types

### Individual

Personal prayer is to absorb God. According to the Scripture, one should unceasingly pray (1 Thes. 5:17), which is to be continually in spirit praying short prayers throughout the day.

### Corporate

Corporate prayer is to bind and to loose what has been bound and loosed in the heavens. That is, to fight the spiritual warfare.
