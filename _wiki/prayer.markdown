>"But you, beloved, building up yourselves upon your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit"

\- Jude 20

## Background

TODO: clean up background

**Prayer** is to contact God in the spirit (Eph. 6:18) to absorb God, which is to have fellowship with God. Prayer is the believers' response to God's flowing in, and their flowing back to God. Real prayer includes entering into God's presence took look at Him, behold Him, praise Him, give thanks to Him, and worship Him to enjoy His riches. Prayer should also be a living, unceasingly talking to God throughout the day in every  in every place (1 Thes. 5:17; 1 Tim. 2:8), but specific times should also be set aside for praying in private (Matt. 14:23; Mark 1:35; Luke 5:16). This means coming to the Lord regardless of one's spiritual or physical condition. Even if someone is weak, confused, sad and speechless, they still must come to God and bring it to God. 

Prayer may start in the self, but with the proper yearning and turning, one can contact God which brings them into a bilaterally active touch with Him where they enter into Him as the Spirit in their spirit. As a result, this prayer is also truly what is on God's heart, and all such prayers will be answered (John 15:7).


Prayers should be divine facts, for example what the Lord prayed in John 17. Praying for one's need is okay, but it should be prayed in a divine way. 

The reason why we have little experience of this is we haven't paid specific attention to our contact with Him, and through our fellowship with Him fail to bring him into our present frame with us and to hold him there. It it through such a fellowship that we are brought into his being and we can pray in Him and he can pray in us; two are praying together. The simplest way do do this is to call.

## Significance

To pray is to realize that the self is nothing and can do nothing; prayer is the real denial and repudiating of one's self so that one may enjoy Christ as their everything (Col. 4:2; Gal. 2:20).

In prayer, the earth controls the heavens.

## Biblical Examples

### Abraham

The intercession which Abraham made before God for Lot was an intimate conversation between two friends, even with Abraham's bargaining before God (Gen. 18). God appeared to Abraham in the form of a man and communed with Him on a human level (Gen. 13:18; 18:1-2). Notably, God Himself ended the conversation, not Abraham (Gen. 18:33).

### Hannah

For years Hannah prayed to have a son, but it was not until she touched the Lord's burden that she became pregnant (1 Sam. 1:11).  

### Samuel

### David

David many times inquired of God for what to do (1 Sam. 23:2, 4). 

### Daniel

Daniel had particular times throughout the day to pray.

### Jesus

Jesus was the only true "man of prayer" revealed in the Bible. This is because He was truly one with God (John 10:30), God was always with Him (John 8:29), and He committed all things to God (1 Pet. 2:23). As a result, Satan had no ground in the Lord Jesus (John 14:30). 

## Purpose

### God's Will

If God reveals His will to someone, they should pray this will back to Him. We must pray before God will rise up to work (Matt 18:18-20). God will not act independently, we must pray and agree with Him - His goal is to accomplish His will through our prayer. Therefore, prayer is man's working together with God to accomplish His will. If man does not work together with God in prayer for His will, He will not work and cannot work. God's ways and thoughts are higher than man's (Isa. 55:8-9).

We must see this principle: while God cannot do what he wants to do unless man wants it, he likewise will only carry out His will when our prayers are in harmony with His will. For the carrying out of God's economy, it is necessary that we have a corporate prayer of the Church. 

### Dispensing

Through our prayer God passes through our being, and we pass through His being. Our words pass though Him and His words pass through Us and two pray together one prayer. Often the first word of our prayer is of the mind, but by the end, it is altogether of the spirit. The dispensing in God's economy is conditional, and that is based on our prayer. In a sense, our prayer is our "yes" to Him. In another sense, the Lord has applied for a passport to enter into us. Our prayer is the stamp on this passport which allows Him to pass through into us.

## Principles

### Breathing

The Bible says that we should unceasingly pray (1 Thes. 5:17). This is pretty much impossible if one's definition of prayer is asking God to fulfill particular needs. Actually, prayer is just spiritual breathing. When we exercise our spirit to call on the name of the Lord, we breath God in as fresh spiritual air. Calling on the Lord is something that can be done anytime, anywhere.

### Every Place

In 2 Timothy 8, Paul desires men to pray in every place. While Ephesians 6:18 says to pray at every time, here we see that we need to pray in every place. There are some places where it is difficult to pray - for example the movie theater or nightclub. Therefore, the simply solution is to not go to these places. If you cannot pray somewhere, do not go there.

## Types

### Individual

Personal prayer is to absorb God. According to the Scripture, one should unceasingly pray (1 Thes. 5:17), which is to be continually in spirit praying short prayers throughout the day.

### Corporate

Corporate prayer is to bind and to loose what has been bound and loosed in the heavens. That is, to fight the spiritual warfare.

## Tips

1. If you are praying, and what you are praying is distracted from the Lord, then stop and change your way of praying. When we come to pray we have many concepts and end us missing God Himself. We should not be doing anything by ourselves, but everything in God with God and through God.
2. Don't pray for any person or thing without God in view. For example, it is one thing to pray for someone's health, it is another thing to pray that they be restored to their particular function in serving God. This is to seek God and God's will (Matt. 26:39; John 4:34; 5:30).
3. Prayer requires having continued fellowship with God. One must abide in the Lord and for His *rhema* words to abide in them for their prayers to be answered (John 15:7). This means living and walking in God each day, so that God will speak to you and so you can reciprocate this speaking. One's prayer is only at the level of their living. 
4. Rule over your mind; Satan hates prayer and will cause doubts, accusations and temptations during prayer. One's spirit will become strong in this way.
