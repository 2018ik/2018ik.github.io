## Background

The Bible reveals that man has three parts.

## Three Parts

The Lord works in someone first by touching them in their heart, so that they may love Him. Then, this love allows them to exercise their spirit to receive God. Finally, God is able to spread through their being into their soul and body so that they can express God. This is the correct order. We do not exercise our soul and body to do good things so that God will bless us; we allow God to dispense Himself into us first which will spontaneously issue in the outward expression in our actions after He spreads from our spirit into our whole being.

### Body

### Soul

The soul is a reflecting organ (2 Cor. 3:18)

### Spirit

The spirit is a receiving organ (John 4:24).

### (Heart)

The heart, which includes the soul and the conscience places its emphasis on love (Mark 12:30).

## Three Lives

In Romans 7, we have three lives as a regenerated human being - the Divine life in our spirit, the human life in our soul, and the Satanic life in the flesh.

### Spiritual Man

A believer may be a spiritual man, living habitually in his spirit under the annointing of the Holy Spirit (Rom. 8:3, 6; Gal. 5:25). A spiritual man does not behave according to the flesh or soul but lives according to the spirit mingled with the Spirit of God (Phil. 2:1). 

In 1 Cor. 5 Paul says that his spirit will be assembled with the Corinthians. This is a man with a powerful spirit.

### Soulish Man

A soulish man lives under the mind, emotion and will, ignoring the spirit and behaving as if he does not have a spirit. These are those who make divisions (Jude 10).

Animals live under the soul - our pets have a mind, emotion, and will, but they don't have a conscience, and are unable to fathom concepts such as eternity, the meaning of life, etc. We don't see our dogs crouching in the corner having a mid-life crisis.

### Fleshly

*Fleshy* denotes being made of flesh; *fleshly* denotes being influenced by the nature of the flesh and partaking of the character of the flesh.
