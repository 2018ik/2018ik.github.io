## Background

The children's work encompasses all services which deal with raising up the children, generally those of elementary school age. The consensus is that the children's work is a more effective way to gain an increase than the campus work or door knocking, and preaching the gospel in general.

The children's work includes holding meetings, both during Lord's day as well as throughout the week which are focused on shepherding the children, as well as contacting the children's parents or preparing teaching material. Actually, even the children themselves are part of the work: through the church's care, the children become gospel seeds who express Christ to their classmates.

## Goals

### Proper Humanity

On one hand, the children's meeting allows the children to be taken out of the adult's meeting, which they may not understand and serve as a distraction. On the other hand, while the parents play the primary role in nurturing their own children, that does not mean the church should ignore this responsibility; it should make up for what the parents lack. Children before being saved should be taught the law - that is to teach them ethics, morals and culture to build up their humanity (Gal. 3:24). 

### Sense of God

The children should be taught that there is a God who is all-powerful and cares for them. They should be thankful for what God has accomplished for them and given them, and be led to thank God for various things.

### Gospel

The children's work is a gospel work: children can be gained for the gospel. A key difference between parenting and the church's children's work however is that the latter allows friendships to be established between children and families, so that even new families can be gained. Statistics show that of those who are brought into the church life from primary school to college age, there is a *negative* correlation between age and having brought their family into the church life. If children are brought into the church life, there is a much higher chance that the entire household will be brought in.

## History

The children's work was initially just a child-care service, where parents who attend the meeting can leave their children. This was because the children won't easily understand what is going on in the meeting, and can be a distraction. Furthermore, they could develop a negative impression of the meetings be reluctant to attend when they grow up. Therefore, the children's work began. Properly prepared material followed, such as videos and songs. Then, there was a burden to have children meetings not just as the Lord's day meeting daycare but also to continue to foster the children throughout the week.

## Services

In taking care of the children's work, the entire church must be mobilized. Even opening a single house takes the labor of the Body: cleaning, invitations, scheduling, food preparation, transportation, learning material, etc.

### Meetings

There should be a children's meeting held alongside every Lord's day meeting for parents who bring their children. However, to use this space for the gathering of potentially thousands of children in a city is not scalable. Therefore, the best location is in the saint's homes. If a hundred couples have an average of two children, and each family opened their home for a children's meeting for ten, there will be an extra eight hundred spots for other children in the community. These parents do not need to worry about providing the learning material as the church can handle such matters.

In fact, there doesn't need to be teaching material. These gatherings can just be a time to blend and enjoy.

### Preparing Material

Videos, songs, stories and other learning material should be developed as children do not like listening to long messages and sermons. This should be an interactive experience, preferably with a story and illustrations. Age is also a factor that should be considered so as to not introduce premature knowledge. For example, when explaining the creation of man to children, they can understand how God created the heavens and the earth, animals and man, but there is no need to go into the details regarding the Trinity and God's economy. 

Younger children should be taught proper morality to build up their humanity. Biblical truths should not be given away too cheaply. When children hear the same stories over and over again in a low way, for example the prodigal son (Luke 15), they may be veiled and ignore its significance when encountering the deeper truth regarding this chapter when they are older. Yet, these lessons should still include a Bible verse, to ground the lesson in the truth.

### Contacting Parents

The gospel can be spread through the children's meetings. If children from the neighborhood are invited, it presents an opportunity to contact the parents.
