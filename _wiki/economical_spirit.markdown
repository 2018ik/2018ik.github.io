## Background

The economical Spirit is the Spirit of power which equips the believers to carry out His work for the building up of the Body. This Spirit was poured out in Acts 2 on the Day of the Pentecost. This is the same Holy Spirit as the essential spirit, but it is a distinct aspect for the ministry. 

## Biblical Basis

In Luke 24:49, Jesus asked the disciples to stay in the city until they put on power from on high. This is the same power as in Acts 1:8, where the Holy Spirit coming upon the disciples would allow them to become God's witnesses. This was fulfilled in the Jewish believers Acts 2:4, where the disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in different tongues, in order to speak forth God's word. For the Gentile believers, this was fulfilled in the house of Cornelius (Acts 10:44).
