## Background

The **economical Spirit** is the Spirit of power which equips the believers to carry out His work for the building up of the Body. This Spirit was poured out in Acts 2 on the Day of the Pentecost. This is the same Holy Spirit as the essential spirit, but it is a distinct aspect for the ministry. Today, regenerated believers receive the essential and economical Spirit at the same time, as it is one Spirit.

## Biblical Basis

The Spirit descended on the Lord Jesus as a dove despite Him being born of Spirit. The Lord then needed to receive the economical Spirit on top of the essential Spirit to carry out His ministry.

In Luke 24:49, Jesus asked the disciples to stay in the city until they put on power from on high. This is the same power as in Acts 1:8, where the Holy Spirit coming upon the disciples would allow them to become God's witnesses. This was fulfilled in the Jewish believers Acts 2:4, where the disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in different tongues, in order to speak forth God's word. For the Gentile believers, this was fulfilled in the house of Cornelius (Acts 10:44).

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>Brother Nee went to the Philippines in 1937, and so many people came out of the denomination and formed a church there. After they formed the church, they felt they had the leading from the Lord to experience the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. So they fellowshipped with Brother Nee and said, "Can you help us to have such an experience of the Holy Spirit's outpouring?" Brother Nee said, "I cannot help you with that, but you should come to the Lord in desperate prayer." So they said okay, we're going to set this day, and all will come and have a prayer meeting and pray desperately. But Brother Nee said, "That's very good. I will not be there, I will go take a walk in the park." So he did not come to that meeting. This is what we need to do. Nobody else can actually help us. Even Brother Nee cannot help us, and we cannot help him. You must be so desperate. That's why Brother Lee wrote 'desperate and absolute' for the Lord. It's not a small thing. How many of us desire such an outpouring of the Holy Spirit? I hope that we can all experience it at least once, such an outpouring of the Holy Spirit by going to the Lord so desperately. Without the Spirit, you'll be like a car without gasoline, and you need to push the car; the car will move, but it's so slow. If you have the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, then you'll be full of the eternal life of Christ in you, and you'll love the Lord and serve the Lord to the uttermost.
