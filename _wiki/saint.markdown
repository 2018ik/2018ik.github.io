## Background

A **saint** is simply a holy one, set apart from God. All of God's redeemed people are saints (Eph. 1:1; 1 Cor. 1:2). It is not a question that all believers are holy, for they have God's life in them. However, there are varying degrees of holiness which is based on how much they are sanctified in the organic salvation they are experiencing.
