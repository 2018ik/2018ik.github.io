## Background

**Remaining fruit** as in John 15:16 "that your fruit should remain" refers to a gospel preaching that lasts. This is to not only bring people to Christ and to baptize them, but also to continue to feed them, have home meetings with them, and bring them into the church life. The word *remain* in this verse is the same as *abide* in 15:4. The intention is for newly saved ones to also abide in the vine.

To save sinners is not too difficult, but continuing to nourish and cherish them is not easy. For example, in Matthew 13, the seed can easily be sown into various types of earth. However, the seed can be fail to penetrate into the earth and be devoured by birds, or fail to properly grow for other reasons. After the initial seed is planted, preserving the proper growth requires much labor.
