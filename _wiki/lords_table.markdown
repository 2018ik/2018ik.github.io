>"So then let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."

\- 1 Cor. 5:8

## Background

The **Lord's table** is the Lord giving Himself to His believers as the bread and cup that they may partake of Him and enjoy Him (Mark 14:22-24). This table actually implies the entire New Testament economy, which involves the processed consummated Triune God dispensing Himself into us as the Spirit to be our life supply to produce the church as the organic Body of Christ (1 Cor.10:16-17; Eph. 4:16).

To remember the Lord by the table is not to meditate on His processes in our mind, neither it is for some miracle to transubstantiate the elements into some physical substance of God. The reality of the table is not outward things, but Christ coming into the believers to be their spiritual food (John 6:35, 53-57; 63).  We have to exercise the mingled spirit to eat and drink the Lord. If we ever feel that our love for the Lord is waning, we need to feel the undying love of the Lord for us displayed on the table. Our love for the Lord must constantly be renewed that we may come to His table in newness (Matt. 26:29). 

## The Two Elements

> "He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me and I in him."

\- John 6:56

The Lord's table consists of two elements: the bread and the cup (of wine), which represents the Lord's flesh and blood respectively. Flesh and blood are both human elements, which represents his incarnation.

>"For as often as you eat and drink the cup, you declare the Lord's death until He comes."

\- 1 Cor 11:26

By partaking of the cup as the fellowship of the blood of Christ and the bread as the fellowship of the body of Christ we remember Him. We need to be saved from idols, which are signified by the demons' table (1 Cor. 10:21). People from the world drink away their problems - with alcohol, with various other distractions. By partaking of the Lord at His table, he becomes our full satisfaction.

### Bread

The bread unbroken signifies the Lord Jesus Himself as the bread of life (John 6:35). When broken and eaten by the believers, the bread is His body (1 Cor. 11:24) which constitutes each believer with the same Christ that they may be one Body, one universal church (1 Cor. 10:17).

In order for the Lord Jesus to be eaten, He needed to die on the cross. The breaking of the bread signifies the physical body of the Lord being broken. When hearing the sound of the bread breaking, one's hearts should move and realize the suffering the Lord went through because of His love for all mankind.

A superficial description of a believer in Christ may simply go to church every week. However, to be a genuine member, we need to eat, digest and assimilate the crucified Christ. This is symbolized by the breaking and eating of the bread.

### Cup

The cup with its wine signifies the blood of Christ shed for the believers' redemption
To drink the cup is to review the redemption of the new covenant (Matt. 26:28) and to have fellowship in the blood of Christ. While the bread denotes life, the cup is a cup of blessing (1 Cor. 10:16). This is because mankind as sinners was destined for God's wrath (Rev. 14:10), but the Lord Jesus drank that cup on our behalf (John 18:11) that we may partake of the cup of salvation (Psa. 116:13). 

## Table Meeting

>"And one the first day of the week, when we gathered together to break bread..."

\- Acts 20:7

The table meeting is the most important meeting of the church, as it is the meeting which the Lord Jesus Himself instituted. This is the New Testament replacement of the Feast of the Passover, as historically, the Feast of the Unleavened Bread and Passover began on the same day. The Lord Jesus is the reality of the passover (1 Cor 5:??).

The table meeting is one hour out of a 168 hour week where one can be fully locked-in and concentrated on remembering the Lord and worshipping the Father.

### Lord's Supper

The Lord's supper is an aspect of the Lord's table for the remembrance of the Lord (1 Cor. 11:20). The table is  for our enjoyment of Him while the Lord's supper is for His satisfaction.

## Misc. Facts

1. The table is set in the presence of adversaries, so Satan is always waiting to attack (Psa. 23:5)

## Testimonies

### Testimony \#1

> I've always took the Lord superficially at the table, but I was convicted by the Lord for the many substitutes I had for Him. For example, my work and my negative feelings toward my wife. Only after dealing with these things was I able to partake and enter into the enjoyment. 
> 
> You and You alone should be unique constituent of my being. Lord I repent for feeding on so many other things, so many substitutes for Christ. Grant me to be poor in spirit, grant me to be unloaded of any anxieties in my heart that I can be filled with you exclusively that you can be one constituent of my being. 
> 
> Since the bread signifies Your one mystical universal body, I must live in peace with every member of the body of Christ and enjoy you as the peace offering in relation to every member of body of Christ. Help me to see the treasure in earthen vessels - I don't want to look at the clay element which resides in us with my physical eyes; enlighten my heart to see the priceless treasure in every brother and sister. 

### Testimony \#2

>A number of years ago a well meaning saint purchased two tickets for my family to see the play "Christmas Carol" one saturday afternoon. I was trying not to be late since I didn't want a significant price paid by this dear saint to go to waste and I was getting a little nervous because there was considerable traffic that I didn't forsee. But the Lord seemed to be saying in a very living way: "Don't you see there's a feast that I've prepared by paying the highest price that is My precious blood?"
>
>It is by the precious blood of Christ that the new covenant was established so that we may drink of the cup of blessing the cup of salvation in which God in Christ is our eternal portion and our inheritance. I was so convicted - oh Lord save me from my indifference to the table meeting. I would like to honor your table, honor your supper. What is this clay to the feast of love divine?

>I cry almost every week singing hymns at the Lord's table. Song 12, what is that - it says continually breathe can you come to me. So sing - don't sing with the hymnal. You know you call number 7, and they sing "Glory, glory to the Father..." and they are just staring at the hymnal. Including all the people who have been here for 45 years. You know once I went around during the singing and just closed everyone's hymnals. Also don't just move your jaw, move your spirit. 
>
>Another pet peeve I have is that in 50 minutes of the Lord's table we call like 8 or 9 hymns. We just sing the hymn like 203 or 501, pray a little bit and someone calls another hymn. You gotta be kidding me, you know how many suffering and revelation and experience went into that hymn, and you just call another hymn? Don't just read the hymn - the Bible says *speak* to one another in psalms and hymns. I just have feeling for this, I hate formality. Formality reminds me of formaldehyde: it preserves dead things. You know why you like formality? Because you're comfortable with it. There's no escape from formality except the exercise of the spirit. Don't be formal, come to the table - don't be different purposely - exercise your spirit.
>
>Obviously exhorting this is not going to do much. I practice the things I say, and the others will hopefully receive the pattern osmotically. One of the things I do is I don't stand up and repeat a hymn. I stand up and share a point see there's a big difference. Have a breakthrough. We're so formal! Why don't we shout? Don't pray so much - praise! Prayer is based on one's subjective personal experience at a particular moment, praise is based on God's objective position in victory.
