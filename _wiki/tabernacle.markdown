## Background

The **tabernacle** in the Old Testament was the house of God, which typifies the the New Testament church. Its separation into three parts is also a picture of the tripartite man.

Priests were able to in a typological sense experience Christ as life. On the day on atonement, they were able to go into the Holy of Holies to experience the shekinah glory directly; not something of Him like food, but He Himself. Then as the priest came to join himself to Christ Himself, he entered in Him and enjoyed Him as the contents of the ark which correspond to the furnishings in the Holy Place, but in a deeper way because now the high priest had God Himself and in Christ he had food.

## Description

### Boards

The boards of the tabernacle were one and a half cubits wide, so one board must be joined to another to become three cubits wide, three signifying completeness. This is the building together of the Body as God's dwelling place with each member (Eph. 2:22).

The boards were also made of acacia wood overlaid with pure gold. Gold, signifying divinity, was not capable of standing up by itself. Therefore, the gold was overlaid upon acacia wood, which signifies the proper humanity. The humanity in the church is what allows it to stand.

### Clasps

The boards were held together by gold clasps, indicating that only the divine nature of God can hold the church together.
