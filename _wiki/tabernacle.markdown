## Background

Priests were able to in a typological sense experience Christ as life. On the day on atonement, they were able to go into the Holy of Holies to experience the shekinah glory directly; not something of Him like food, but He Himself. Then as the priest came to join himself to Christ Himself, he entered in Him and enjoyed Him as the contents of the ark which correspond to the furnishings in the Holy Place, but in a deeper way because now the high priest had God Himself and in Christ he had food.
