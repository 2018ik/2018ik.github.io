## Background

**The right hand of God** indicates the highest position of power and kingship. Through resurrection, the Lord Jesus was elevated to the right hand of God (Matt. 26:64; Rom. 8:34), where He intercedes for us. This is also prophesied in Psalms 110 and 118.

While He is at this high position, He is also the Lord Spirit who indwells us.
