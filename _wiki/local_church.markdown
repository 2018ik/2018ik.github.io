## Background

A **local church** is the Body of Christ expressed locally in a particular city - for example Antioch (Acts 13:1). The Bible reveals that there is one church per city; there is not a single city mentioned in the New Testament which had multiple churches. This is the practical way in which the Body of Christ can be expressed.

## Biblical Basis

In the New Testament, whenever the plural "churches" is used, it is to refer to a group of churches in a particular region e.g. Galatia (Gal. 1:2). On the other hand, for any individual city, the singular "church" is always used (Acts 13:1; 15:4; Rom.16:1; 1 Cor. 1:2; 1 Thes. 1:1; Rev. 2:1).When John addressed the churches in Asia in Revelation 2 and 3, each church was addressed specifically as the "church in" each of the seven cities. 

## History

The establishment of local churches began from the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1) in the city of Jerusalem (Acts 2:5; 8:1). As a result of persecution, the early Christians were scattered, fulfilling the Lord's prophecy (Acts 1:8; Acts 8:1) that churches be established in Judea and Samaria. The work then reached Galilee as well (Acts 9:31). Then, the gospel spread to Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch (Acts 11:19-26), then Syria and Cilicia (Acts 15:40-41).

Next was Asia Minor in the province of Galatia, where the apostles established churches in Lystra, Iconium and Antioch (a different Antioch than the one before, which was in Pisidia) (Acts 14:21-23). Then, seven churches were established in Asia: Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea (Rev. 1:11).

Churches were eventually raised in Europe as well: Macedonia (2 Cor. 8:1), Philippi (Phil. 1:1), Thessalonica (Acts 16:9-12; 17:1-4; 1 Thes. 1:1), Corinth (1 Cor. 1:2), Cenchrea (Romans 16:1), Rome (Romans 1:7).

Jerusalem was the center of the Jewish religion, and the church there was primarily composed of Jews. On the other hand, Antioch was the center of the gentile world. Antioch was chosen by the Lord to carry out this new move to the gentiles. 

The group of believers in Antioch was quite diverse: Jews, Romans, those of African descent, those related Herod, etc. The Church is composed of all kinds of people in all kinds of backgrounds. We are different in the old creation, but one in Christ.

## Three Elements

Suppose a church is very rowdy, disorderly, divisive and brought lawsuits upon each other constantly - is it a local church? Well, this describes the church in Corinth, which is nonetheless a local church. What constitutes a local church are the following three elements.

### Ground of Locality

The Bible reveals that there should be one church in one city.

### Oneness of the Body

A genuine local church must be in the fellowship of the body, and receive all the believers in the city.

## Function

### Administration

Matthew 18:17 says "But if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church." The church here is the local church, and must administrate over this situation.

### Kingdom Authority

The local churches are the practical way through which God establishes His kingdom on earth today.

In verse 18 the Lord Jesus says, "Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on the earth shall be what has been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall be what has been loosed in heaven." Here to bind means to condemn, and to loose means to forgive. As in 16:19, what we bind or loose on earth should be what has been bound or loosed already in heaven.

The kingdom authority can be exercised by the church to deal with the offending brother. The brother mentioned in 18:15-17 is first offending and then rebellious. First he offends someone. Then because he will not listen to the one he has offended, to two or three witnesses, or even to the church, he becomes rebellious. Because he rebels against the church, the church must exercise its authority to bind and loose. When he repents, the church must forgive him and restore him to the fellowship of the church. 

## Offices

There is a pattern established in the New Testament regarding the offices of the local churches. As revealed in Acts and the epistles, there are elders (overseers) and deacons (serving ones). These offices are **not** for hierarchy, but to practically lead, shepherd and teach.

### Elders

Elders (Acts 20:17), or overseers (20:28) are a individuals of maturity who oversee a particular local church. "Elder" denotes spiritual maturity, while "overseer" denotes the function. This is not to create a hierarchy, but to shepherd the church of God.

### Serving Ones

Serving ones (Acts 6:2) or deacons (Phil. 1:1) are those who serve under the leadership of the overseers. 

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

> So how does a local church have the authority to administrate over its members? In both Matthew 16:18 and 18:18, we see that whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven, where bind means to condemn, and loose means to forgive. Both of these were said in the context of the church, which universally is the kingdom of God on earth today.
>
>Therefore, the local church, as the practical expression of the universal church, has the authority to exercise this kingdom authority on those who rebel. So when one offends, and would not listen to the church, the church must exercise this kingdom authority to bind the brother, that is to condemn and to cut him off from fellowship. However this is not condemnation for the sake of punishment, but to lead him to repentance. If he repents, the church then must forgive him and restore him to fellowship. 
>
> It is this simple - there is no drama, no politics, no backstabbing - the church exercises its kingdom authority to bind and to loose what has been bound and loosed in the heavens. This is neither an individual matter, nor something of man. It is the authority given to the church, and it is the authority to bind and loose what has already been accomplished in the heavens.

### Testimony #2

>We are now more clear on the purposes of the two offices in the local church. There is no complex hierarchy as in Roman Catholicism or today's corporations. Elders and deacons are not here to annul the functions of the other members, nor to lord it over the members so as to create a hierarchy. In Acts 20:28 and 1 Peter 5:2, the elders are told to shepherd the church of God and the flock of God. God has allotted the church to the elders for their temporary care in the present age. However, eternally the church is God's possession. The elders and deacons have no ground to exercise their personal authority over the church. The function of all the members, such as the overseeing and serving functions, are needed for the church to be built up.
