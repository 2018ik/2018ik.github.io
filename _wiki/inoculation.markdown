## Background

**Inoculation** refers to protection against the poison of the enemy, who is always coming to steal, kill and destroy (John 10:10). The scientific definition of inoculation is to expose someone to a little bit of a germ so their immune system builds up antibodies to protect them from getting the actual disease. Likewise, this spiritual inoculation is to protect new ones from the inevitable attacks of the enemy. 

In particular, this is to educate new ones regarding the persecution of the believers (John 15:18-21; 16:1-4) and the slandering of the Lord's ministry (1 Thes. 2:14-16; 3:3-4). This kind of education requires the imparting both truth and life, and is not a one-time event. 

## Biblical Basis

When the Lord was being persecuted, He inoculated the disciples to know that He would also be persecuted. In John 15:18-21, He tells His disciples that the world hates them and that they are not of the world. Later in 16:1-4, He tells the disciples to not be stumbled by persecution. 

When Paul wrote his epistles, there were many 

## Steps

To inoculate, one must be:

1. Equipped with the truth so that the truth can be presented clearly and reasonably
2. A living that is a pattern and a proper testimony for God (see: [Person & Living](../person_living))
3. Loving care

Inoculation should be administered early in the shepherding of new ones, even in the first contact. But as an ongoing process, it should be progressive and should eventually touch the ministry, the church, and the various false accusations made.

A few reasons why the ministry is unfairly criticized is due to its:

1) Origin being an old Chinese man from China who doesn't speak English very well
2) Pointing out of the issues of denominations, to bring back the ground of locality of the churches
3) Pointing out of the issues of the Catholic church

## Antidote

Unlike inoculation, an antidote is applied *after* the poison. This is to correct those who oppose or are exposed to those who oppose. This should be done in meekness (2 Tim. 2:25) and with prayer to bind the enemy (Matt. 12:29). The view hear is to listen to see where they are coming from, and to turn them from darkness to light without arguing or debating.

Specifically, they should be reminded of what they have already seen and experienced of the Lord (2 Pet. 1:12). They should be brought back to the truth in the Bible. Ministry quotes should be brought back into context. They should be helped to touch the Lord in their spirit through prayer. Lastly, not any single individual may have the antidote; one should not be pressured to give an immediate answer or antidote, in which case they should fellowship with the Body.
