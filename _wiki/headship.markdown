>"Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ."

\- 1 Cor. 11:3

## Background

The **headship** is a matter of authority, and the unique Head of the Body is Christ (Eph. 1:22). Subjecting oneself to Christ's headship is to be under His throne, and the one sitting on the throne is the Triune God - God, the Lamb and the Spirit (Rev. 22:1-2). 

## Significance

Holding the Head, who is Christ, allows for the growth of the Body (Col. 2:19). 

## Biblical Basis

### Man and Woman

Brothers have the privilege to take the lead, but it is not to rule over or control anyone. It is to be a pattern to jump into the flow of the Spirit.

We don't use the natural man to do anything in the church life, but the brothers should take the lead with an exercised spirit in prayer and prophesying. 

Yet, the real Head is the Lord, and all must submit to Him. Therefore, for a bother to assert one's own authority against a sister is invalid, as it is contrary to the headship of Christ which is over man.

However, the most important thing is to keep the oneness, which requires the exercise of the spirit.
