## Background

The **Son of God** is a title given to Christ Jesus with an emphasis on His divinity (as opposed to son of man which places the emphasis on His humanity) and is the center of the Divine Trinity with regards to His relationship to man.

1. Isaiah 9:6 says the Son is the eternal Father, not vice-versa.
2. 2 Corinthians 3:17 says the Lord is the Spirit, not vice-versa.
3. The Bible makes most evident calling on the name of the Lord Jesus, not the Father nor the Spirit (Acts 7:59; Rom. 8:9-11).
4. The Father is pleased to reveal His *Son* in us, not Himself (Gal. 1:15-16).
5. Our access to the Father is through the Son (Eph. 2:18)

## Only-begotten

Even before His incarnation, Jesus was the only-begotten Son of God. 

## Designated

Before the incarnation of Jesus, Christ was already the Son of God (Rom 8:3). However, through incarnation, He put on the human element, which needed to be sanctified and uplifted by passing through death and resurrection. In Romans 1:4, we see that He was *designated* the *firstborn* Son of God (in contrast with *only*-begotten Son of God in John 3:16). 

Designation implies there was something not "Son of God"-like before, and that would be the humanity of Jesus. Now as the Son of God, he possesses both divinity and humanity. 

### Firstborn 

In eternity, there was the only-begotten Son (John 3:16). However, this designated One is also the firstborn, and not just the only-begotten, meaning there will be more sons in the future. Christ the firstborn son serves as a prototype to produce His many sons. We too can be designated and revealed as sons of God, possessing both divinity and humanity.
