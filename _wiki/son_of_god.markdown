## Background

## Designated

Before the incarnation of Jesus, Christ was already the Son of God (Rom 8:3). However, through incarnation, He put on the human element, which needed to be sanctified and uplifted by passing through death and resurrection. In Romans 1:4, we see that He was *designated* the *firstborn* Son of God (in contrast with *only*-begotten Son of God in John 3:16). 

Designation implies there was something not "Son of God"-like before, and that would be the humanity of Jesus. Now as the Son of God, he possesses both divinity and humanity. 

As this designated One is the firstborn, and not the only-begotten, there will be more sons in the future. Christ the firstborn son serves as a prototype to produce His many sons. We too can be designated and revealed as sons of God, possessing both divinity and humanity.
