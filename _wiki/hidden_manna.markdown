## Background

The **hidden manna** was an omer of manna stored in a pot which was kept in the Ark of the Covenant within the Holy of Holies, along with Aaron's rod and the tablets of the covenant (Exo. 16:32; Heb. 9:3-4). Manna typifies Christ as food for God's people in a public way; the hidden manna is to experience Christ in the deepest way.   

The temple and tabernacle in the Old testament is a picture of the tripartite man, with the Holy of Holies typifying the spirit. Therefore, the hidden manna is the portion of Christ that we enjoy in the presence of God when there is no distance between us and Him.

## Divine Incorporation

The location of the hidden manna reveals the divine incorporation of the Father and Son, and God with man. The hidden manna typifying the Son as food (John 6:35) is stored in a golden pot, typifying the Father as the one who is altogether divine. Then, the golden pot is placed within the Ark, which typifies Christ as the embodiment of God with acacia wood overlaid with gold. This depicts the Son within the Father within the Son (John 14:10). The Ark in the Holy of Holies is Christ as the Spirit within the human spirit, which is in the tabernacle of the human body. Thus, the entire Triune God is in man's spirit.
