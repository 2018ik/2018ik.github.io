## Background

In the Holy of Holies was the Ark of the Covenant, in which were the golden pot that had the manna and Aaron's rod that budded and the tablets of the covenant (Heb. 9:3-4). The temple in the Old testament is a picture of the tripartite man, with the Holy of Holies typifying the spirit. The hidden manna is the portion of Christ that we enjoy in the presence of God when there is no distance between us and Him.
