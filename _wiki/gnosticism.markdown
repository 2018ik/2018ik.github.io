## Background

**Gnosticism** was a mixture of Jewish, Oriental and Greek philosophies in the early church which brought in ritualistic practices regarding eating, drinking, washings and asceticism (Col. 2:8, 16, 20-22; Titus 1:14-15). Paul speaks against these philosophies in many of His epistles, such as Colossians, Titus, Romans, and Timothy. One can live according to gnostic philosophy and be a good person, but such living is not according to God's economy.
