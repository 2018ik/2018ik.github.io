## Background

Throughout the Bible and church history, **Young people** are the demographic who are most frequently called by God to change the age.

Generally speaking, young people are those who are considered young in the current era, probably up to 25 years old or so. "Young person" may also refer specifically to someone who is middle and highschool-aged.

## Significance

When God calls people, He calls young people. In the Old Testament, Moses, Joshua, Caleb, Samuel, David, Daniel, etc. were all called when they were young. In the New Testament, during Stephen's martyrdom, his garments were laid at the feet of a young man called Saul (Acts 7:58). Peter, Andrew, James and John were also called when they were young. When someone is old, they tend to be set, settled and occupied; it is difficult to have change from within. 

Whenever God calls us, he always has something new to do. He has a desire to turn the age which requires something revolutionary. This is why we need a new start with the Lord every day - this it to be young in our spirit.

## How To Lead 

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Have an interest and a heart for all | One should have a universal interest in all young people, whether good or bad. Furthermore, forebearance must be exercised when dealing with their typical worldly behavior (e.g. watching movies, playing video games). We must not judge or provoke them but to be patient and sympathetic. |
| Pay attention to regular contact | Have many normal contacts, and do not immediately attempt to impart the gospel into them. Likewise, don't stir up negative feelings by talking to them right awy about reading the Bible or praying. Eventually, a genuine relationship will be built up. |
| Pay attention to personal contact | Contact should be individual. As in the God-ordained way, large gospel meetings are good for begetting, but not for nourishing new ones to bring them on. Likewise, contacting the young people must be personal for their perfecting. |
| More practicality and less doctrine | The more we speak doctrines, the more young people become dead, cold and backsliding. Rather, be practical. Sense their feelings, and solve their problems with a practical word. |
| Having a positive faith | No one knows whether a young person will grow up good or bad. Rather than having faith in our faulty perception of a person's condition, we fully believe that God will gain tem one day. |
| Adapt to their condition | Match the young people, rather than vice versa. If a young person is busy with sports or academics, match them and participate in that activity. If a young person is interested in something, they will find time for it; therefore, the best way to spend time with them is to participate in that interest. |
