## Background

Throughout the Bible and church history, **Young people** are the demographic who are most frequently called by God to change the age.

Generally speaking, young people are just those who are considered young in the current era, probably up to 25 years old or so. In the Lord's Recovery may refer specifically to those who are middle and highschool-aged.

## Significance

When God calls people, He calls young people. In the Old Testament, Moses, Joshua, Caleb, Samuel, David, Daniel, etc. were all called when they were young. In the New Testament, during Stephen's martyrdom, his garments were laid at the feet of a young man called Saul (Acts 7:58). Peter, Andrew, James and John were also called when they were young. When someone is old, they tend to be set, settled and occupied; it is difficult to have change from within. 

Whenever God calls us, he always has something new to do. He has a desire to turn the age which requires something revolutionary. This is why we need a new start with the Lord every day - this it to be young in our spirit.

The Lord doesn't need spiritual giants, he needs little captives. We need to pray for the Lord to conquer us and to never let us win, and to defeat us all the time. Ironically in God's eternal economy, our defeat means we are winning.
