## Background

**Personal time** is time spent by a believer to personally cultivate their relationship with God. Every believer's relationship with Christ should be personal and affectionate; no one can represent any one else in this matter. On one hand, the Christian life is a Body matter; one the other hand, we must have an individual drawing from the Lord. There is a particular intimacy and closeness of the Lord that can only be experienced through personal time with Him.

## Biblical Basis

(TODO add references)

Matthew 6 says to pray in a private room and to shut your door. 

The seeker in Song of Songs says "draw me" not "draw us." 

Isaiah says that our God is a God who hides Himself.

The Bible often compares the believers to plants. If a plant's roots are not deep enough, it will dry out when the scorching sun comes. The roots of a plant are hidden and private. The time spent developing this root system is during personal time.

## Practice

Much of the [practice of morning revival](../morning_revival#how-to-practice) also applies to personal time. This a time set apart solely to contact God and should not be rushed.
