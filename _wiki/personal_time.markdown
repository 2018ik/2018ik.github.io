## Background

**Personal time** is time spent by a believer to personally cultivate their relationship with God. Every believer's relationship with Christ should be personal and affectionate; no one can represent any one else in this matter. The seeker in Song of Songs says "draw me" not "draw us." On one hand, the Christian life is a Body matter; one the other hand, we must have a drawing from the Lord that is His personal and affectionate doing.
