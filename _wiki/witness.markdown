## Background

A **witness** of Christ is one who has seen Christ and can testify concerning Him, having seen His resurrection (Acts 1:8). One testifies concerning Christ not only by speaking about what they know, but by living their life in resurrection.

## Biblical Examples

### Paul

After Paul was brought to Ananias, he said to Paul, "You will be a witness to Him unto all men of the things which you have seen and heard" (Acts 22:15). On one hand, Paul spoke according to what he saw. On the other hand, Paul lived according to who he was constituted with. Whenever people saw Paul, they saw Christ magnified (Phil. 1:20).
