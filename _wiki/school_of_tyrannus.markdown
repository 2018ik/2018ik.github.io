## Background

The **School of Tyrannus**, referenced only  once in Acts 19:8-10, was a school in Ephesus where Paul taught at daily for two years. He previously taught in the synagogue for three months, but after some began speaking evil of the Way, he began reasoning instead in the school of Tyrannus.

## Significance

After teaching for two years in Ephesus, all those dwelling in Asia heard the word of the Lord (Acts 19:10). This indicates that many who went to the school must've gone out to preach the gospel in their hometowns after completing their schooling.
