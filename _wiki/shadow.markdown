## Background

**Shadow** refers to the things of the material realm being temporal shadows of the reality in Christ. Every good thing which we see on earth is a picture of the goodness of Christ and should remind us of Christ.

## Examples

| Man | One new man | Man was created in the image and likeness of God to express God in the old creation. Christ has abolished the old creation, and created in Himself one new man. |
