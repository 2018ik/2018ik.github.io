## Background

The **outer man** needs to be broken in order for the spirit to be released. This allows the believers to bear fruit (John 12:24), and for Christ to be expressed in a corporate way. When a believer is attacked, persecuted or in much suffering, it only gives them the opportunity to die i.e. break their outer man and to release the divine life in their spirit. In this respect those who see this fact are invincible. 

## Biblical Basis

Like the grain of wheat falling in the ground to die, we likewise need to die and have our outer man broken in order to bear fruit.

> In 1970s Bro lee asked a small group of brothers to be with him every week. One oft he last times that we were with him he wanted us to sing a hymn, which was 837, which is one the building of the church. But there are two stanzas here that indicate this is something that's a part of the building in resurrection

"here lord we give ourselves to thee"
"receive us into thy wise hands
bend break and build tgoether in thee to be thy house to meet thy demands"
"Break all the natural life for us"
deal thou with each peculiar way that we no more independent be
but with all saints our one for aye

Christ needs to be released from the imprisonment of our soul. Through the breaking of the outer man for the release of the spirit. We have Christ in our spirit but there may be no room or ground for him in our mind, emotion and will. if this is our situation our spirit is not a residence for Christ, but a prison for Him. Christ is imprisoned by our soul if the mind, emotion and will do not let Him to flow out.
