## Background

The **outer man** needs to be broken in order for us to be used by the Lord to bear much fruit. This involves breaking the shell of one's soul-life. When we are buried, that is attacked, it only gives us the opportunity to die and bear much fruit. In this respect those who see this fact are invincible. 

## Biblical Basis

Like the grain of wheat falling in the ground to die, we likewise need to die and have our outer man broken in order to bear fruit.
