## Background

**Eve** (meaning *living*) was the wife of Adam who was built from his rib (Gen. 2:22). She was deceived by the Satan, leading to fall of man. She is also a type of the church in parallel to Adam being a type of Christ.

## Significance

Just as God built Eve using that which came out from Adam, God is building the church today using that which comes out of Christ. The rib typifies the unbreakable life of Christ; after Eve, the Body of Christ was built, she was brought to Adam as the bride. Genesis 5:2 says that God created male and female and called *their* name Adam, indicating that Christ and the church are a single corporate entity. This is in line with the NT revelation of the church being the expansion of Christ, rather than a separate entity.

| Adam and Eve | Church |
| --- | --- |
| Adam was created first, then Eve | Christ was the firstborn of all creation, then mankind (Col. 1:15) |
| There was not found a help meet for Adam who matched him (Gen. 2:20) | God created man that man might become God in life and nature to match God (see: God's Economy) |
| A deep sleep fell upon Adam (Gen. 2:21) | Christ was put to death temporarily, that is to sleep in His own words (Matt. 12:40; John 11:11; Luke 8:52) |
| Adam had a rib taken from him, presumably the side of his body (Gen. 2:21-22) | The Lord Jesus had the side of His body opened, and blood and water came forth signifying redemption and eternal life with which the church is built up (John 19:34) |
| A rib was used to build Eve (this is also the first mention of a bone in the Bible, strongly indicating a type) | The Lord Jesus was prophesied to not have a single bone broken (Psalm 34:20). The fact that none of His bones broke despite his physical death indicates that the bones signify the resurrection life which contrasts with His bodily death. This resurrection life is typified by Adam's bone. |
| Eve came out of Adam (Gen. 2:23) | The church comes out of Christ |
| Eve was built (Gen. 2:22) | The church is built (Matt. 16:18) |
