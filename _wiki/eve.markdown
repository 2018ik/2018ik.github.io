## Background

**Eve** (meaning *living*) was the wife of Adam who was built from his rib (Gen. 2:22). 

## Significance

Just as God built Eve using that which came out from Adam, God is building the church today using that which comes out of Christ. The rib typifies the unbreakable life of Christ; after Eve, the Body of Christ was built, she was brought to Adam as the bride. The fact that male and female were called by *their* name as Adam indicates that Christ and the church are a single corporate entity (Gen. 5:2).
