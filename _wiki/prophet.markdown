## Background

A **Prophet** is one who speaks for God and speaks forth God by Godâ€™s revelation. In the Old Testaments, prophets spoke often with inspired prediction, however this occurs less in the New Testament. Actually, New Testament prophets prophesy for the sake of building up the church (1 Cor. 14:26), and all may prophesy (1 Cor. 14:24). In order to be a prophet, one must have the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge. 

## Significance

In the churches today there should be prophets receiving the divine revelation and the light, prophets who know the truth, who have the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge, and who speak for God and speak God forth into others. The more such prophets speak for God and even speak God, the more the Triune God is dispensed into others.
