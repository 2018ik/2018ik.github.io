## Background

To **taste** the Lord is to experience Him by eating Him. It's one thing to taste something physically, or to know doctrinally that the Lord is good, but each believer must taste and see for themselves that God is good (Psa. 34:8). If one tastes that the Lord is good, they will long to drink the milk of the Word (1 Pet. 2:2-3).

In tasting the Lord, believers should ask themselves two questions: "Do I taste the Lord and see that He is good?" and "Do I long for more of the Word and more Christ?" A genuine relationship with the Lord is one where both parties long for each other greatly. The Psalmist in Psalms 42 experienced the taste of Christ to such an extent that they were able to describe their experience as a panting hart which thirsts after streams of water (Psa. 42:1). If even an Old Testament psalmist can have such an experience, how much more should we, who have the New Testament, experience the Lord in this way.
