## Background

**Creeds** in the early church were composed to describe what Christians believe because they were facing much persecution even from each other and needed to defend the faith. Thus, they composed creeds - short statements of faith - that were not intended to be prescriptive, but to describe what they believed. Eventually these creeds did become prescriptive, that is they define the Christian faith. However, they were rather brief, and did not fully cover the matters of the Divine Trinity and the son of God Jesus Christ, bringing about much contention.
