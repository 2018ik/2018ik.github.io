## Background

**Creeds** in the early church were composed to describe what Christians believe because they were facing much persecution even from each other and needed to defend the faith. Thus, they composed creeds - short statements of faith - that were not intended to be prescriptive, but to target key issues which were dividing the believers. Eventually these creeds did become prescriptive, that is they defined the Christian faith and was considered the full body of the truth. However, they were rather brief, and did not fully cover the matters of the Divine Trinity and the son of God Jesus Christ, bringing about much contention.

## History

### The Apostles' Creed

The earliest creed is the Apostles' creed, which originated with a group of church fathers in the beginning of the second century shortly after the passing away of the original apostles. The Apostles' Creed basically declared the belief in the Lord Jesus being the Son of God, conceived of the Holy Spirit and virgin Mary, and His death, resurrection, ascension and second coming.

## Inadequacy

The creeds can be seen as clearly insufficient in expounding the full revelation of the Bible as it does not cover any of the below 15 points:

1. The last Adam becoming the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b)
2. The Lord being the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17)
3. The seven Spirits (Rev. 1:4; 3:1; 4:5; 5:6)
4. The Son being called the eternal Father (Isa. 9:6)
5. The coinherence of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (John 14:10, 20; 10:38; 17:21, 23)
6. The Son being the effulgence of God’s glory and the impress of God’s substance (Heb. 1:3; Col. 1:15a; 2 Cor. 4:4.)
7. The Spirit being the eyes of the Son (Rev. 5:6; Zech. 3:9; 4:10.)
8. The Son as the Angel of Jehovah; as Jehovah, the self-existing and ever-existing One; and as Elohim, the Triune God (Exo. 3:2-15; 14:19; 23:20-21; Judg. 13:15-21; cf. Rev. 7:2; 8:3; 10:1; 18:1.)
9. The Son as the One sent by Jehovah and as Jehovah, the Sender (Zech. 2:8-11).
10. When Christ, the Son, was baptized, the Spirit descending upon Him; when He died, God forsaking Him (Matt. 3:16; 27:46).
11. The Son being the only begotten Son of the Father and the firstborn Son of God (John 1:18; 3:18; Rom. 8:29).
12. The Son being the Firstborn of all creation (Col. 1:15b).
13. The blood shed by the Son in His humanity being called the blood of God’s Son and God’s own blood (1 John 1:7; Acts 20:28).
14. Christ being the mystery of God, and in Him all the fullness of the entire Godhead — the Father, the Son, and the Spirit — dwelling bodily (Col. 2:2, 9).
15. Christ, the Son, being the embodiment of the fullness of the divinity of the entire Triune God (Col 2:9).

Just considering the first two items - Christ became the life-giving Spirit to be experienced by man - if this fact is rejected on the basis of it not being in the creeds, then the entire basis of organic salvation is rejected. How is one to live a Christian life if it is solely based on the creeds? Regardless, it would be a truly pitiful Christian life.
