## Background

**Heading up** is to take Christ as the head that He would direct every move of the Body, the church. Does the body support the head, or does the head uphold the body? The head upholds the body. If you cut a person's head off, the body falls on the ground. In today's Christianity and in the world - the school, at work, in the government - nothing is headed up. Therefore, everything is in a state of chaos and collapse.

## Biblical Basis

In Ephesians 1:10 we see that God's economy is for the heading up of all things in Christ. This means that every step we take should be headed up in Christ, and that He should direct us in everything we do.

This is the fulfillment of Ephesians 1:22-23 and Ephesians 4:22. In Christ's ascension, He was given to be head over all things to the church (Eph. 1:20-22). Then, after the believers put off their old man, they are able to head up all things in Christ, as the new husband in Romans 7.
