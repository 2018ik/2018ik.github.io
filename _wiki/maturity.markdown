## Background

**Maturity**, resulting from the growth in life, is to be filled with the divine life in every part of one's being, not just the spirit but the mind, emotion and will. The result of maturity is that the bride of Christ would be prepared for His coming.

The primary characteristic of one who is mature in life is that they [reign in life](../reigning_in_life), meaning that are restricted, limited and ruled by the Spirit.
