## Background

**Maturity** is to be filled with the divine life in every part of one's being and is the last stage of transformation and overlaps with conformation. Transformation is a change in life, while maturity is the fullness of life. Only when we are transformed can we be filled with life in its fullness. The result of maturity is that the bride of Christ would be prepared for His coming.

The primary characteristic of one who is mature in life is that they [reign in life](../reigning_in_life), meaning that are restricted, limited and ruled by the Spirit.
