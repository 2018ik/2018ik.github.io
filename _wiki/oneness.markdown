## Background

**Oneness** is the state of being one, to the extent of reproducing the oneness of the Triune God. To be one with the other members of the Body of Christ requires putting off natural preference. Most problems prevailing in Christianity today are due to differing opinions regarding things which have nothing to do with the faith. However, oneness is not predicated upon having the same opinions and interpretations but by living in the Triune God, that the same Triune God can be constituted into all the members of the Body of Christ that they may be one intrinsically.

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

> When we meet at a certain locality, we must learn to be liberal, like Paul, who would even become vegetarian for the oneness. If we disagree with what everyone else is doing, we should not argue with them or insist on our ways. If we come to all the meetings burning with Christ, the fire of Christ will get into the meeting through us, and nothing else will matter. Rather than convincing people by means of organizational and managerial tactics, we should simply be filled with Christ. When we come to a new locality, whether or not they play the piano, say amen, pray-read, or leaven their bread, we simply do not care. We simply meet on the ground of locality and enjoy Christ, and the rest will follow.
