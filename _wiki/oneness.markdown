## Background

**Oneness** is the state of being one and is an attribute of the Triune God. This oneness is very different than the oneness the world talks about; in every worldly institution, be it a school, community or army, the members want to be one. Throughout history, there were many philosophies and movements which tried to achieve oneness which inevitably fail. Today, there is still war, strife and division because it is impossible for man to be one. Oneness is uniquely an attribute of God and can only be realized by the Body of Christ. By virtue of the seven ones in Ephesians 4 (one Body, Spirit, Lord, faith, baptism, God, Father), we have been put into Christ to become His sons in life and members of one Body in Christ (Gal. 3:27-28; Rom. 12:5). When the oneness of God is practiced, it is the one accord.

To be one with the other members of the Body of Christ requires putting off natural preference. Most problems prevailing in Christianity today are due to differing opinions regarding things which have nothing to do with the faith. However, oneness is not predicated upon having the same opinions and interpretations but by living in the Triune God, that the same Triune God can be constituted into all the members of the Body of Christ that they may be one intrinsically.

## Significance

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

> When we meet at a certain locality, we must learn to be liberal, like Paul, who would even become vegetarian for the oneness. If we disagree with what everyone else is doing, we should not argue with them or insist on our ways. If we come to all the meetings burning with Christ, the fire of Christ will get into the meeting through us, and nothing else will matter. Rather than convincing people by means of organizational and managerial tactics, we should simply be filled with Christ. When we come to a new locality, whether or not they play the piano, say amen, pray-read, or leaven their bread, we simply do not care. We simply meet on the ground of locality and enjoy Christ, and the rest will follow.
