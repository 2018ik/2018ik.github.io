## Background

The **Bible** as the written word of God explains who God is. When we touch this written word in a certain way, we get God. The major revelation in the Bible in the unique divine economy of the unique Triune God. The content of this economy is Christ, the embodiment and expression of God.

The truths in the Bible are not presented in an orderly sequence, but scattered throughout the Bible. This can be likened to a jigsaw puzzle; the full scene of the Bible from end to end is not very clear from the outset.

## Old Testament

## New Testament

The essence of the New Testament is the Spirit of God mingled with the spirit of man to become one (1 Cor. 6:17).

The New Testament was written because the believers were bad, and to counteract the degradation of the churches.

## Emphasis

When one comes to the Bible, it is easy to have a thought or view that a particular item is the most important. Thus, it is important to interpret the Bible with the entire Bible. However, there is inevitably going to be differing interpretations among believers as long as the flesh still exists, so the divine revelation of the Bible can be divided into three categories: the central line, supplemental line, and leaves and branches.
