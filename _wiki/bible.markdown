## Background

The Bible as the written word of God explains who God is. When we touch this written word in a certain way, we get God. This is beginning of everything.

## Old Testament

## New Testament

The New Testament was written because the believers were bad, and to counteract the degradation of the churches.

## Emphasis

When one comes to the Bible, it is easy to have a thought or view that a particular item is the most important. One way of dividing the divine revelation of the Bible can be the below three categories: the central line, supplemental line, and leaves and branches.

### Central Line

The central line should always stand out. This is based on 1 Timothy 1:3-4 where Paul charges Timothy not to be distracted by unending genealogies and questionings.

### Supplemental Line

### Leaves and Branches
