## Background

In the Old Testament, the firstfruits each harvest were offered to God for His satisfaction. They were to be taken into the house of God and waved to God. This is what took place on the day of the Lord's resurrection; the Lord Jesus resurrected as the firstfruits of resurrection (1 Cor. 15:20, 23). This is why He did not allow Mary to touch Him - because He had to offer himself to God the Father first in the freshness of His resurrection for the Father's satisfaction.

## History

### Enoch

One of the shining traits of Enoch was that he obtained the testimony that he had been well pleasing to God. This is a picture of the firstfruits, as someone who was taken away by God.

## Significance

In our spirit is a Person who longs to satisfy God the Father. We need to take the Lord as the reality of all the offerings.

### Second Coming

All the overcoming believers will be raptured prior to the three and a half year great tribulation as the firstfruits to God and to the Lamb. However, the highest incentive for us to be the firstfruits is to satisfy God, not to escape tribulation. Then eventually, all the graves will open, and all will resurrect.
