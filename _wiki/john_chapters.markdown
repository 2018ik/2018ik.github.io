## Background

## Significance

## 14

In verse 26, the Spirit is sent by the Father in the name of the Son. This shows a level of coordination among the three of the divine Trinity.

## 15

According to this chapter, the Father is the husbandman, and has an economy which is nothing less than to grow the vine. The Father's economy is simply the vine. But the Lord Jesus is also the vine; therefore the revelation here is that Christ Himself is also God's economy.

## 17

Everyone know's the Lord's kingdom prayer in Matthew 6, but few know about the much bigger prayer in John 17. In this prayer, the Lord asks the father to glorify the Son. This was fulfilled first in the Lord's resurrection, and then in the church as the Body of Christ. The ultimate fulfillment of this prayer will be the New Jerusalem, where God will be fully glorified in a divine incorporation for eternity.
