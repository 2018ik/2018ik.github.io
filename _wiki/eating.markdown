## Background

Eating is the way through which God becomes one with man. God's first provision for man was to give him food to eat (Gen. 1:29).

## Biblical Basis

Just like in real life, one lives spiritually by eating (John 6:57).

## Practice


## Issues

Eating requires digestion before the food is assimilated. One must be keen to the digestive process. After consuming biblical content, one must continue to muse upon and fellowship with the Lord regarding such things so that the food can be properly digested.
