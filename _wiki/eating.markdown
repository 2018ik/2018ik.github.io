## Background

**Eating** is the way through which God becomes one with man. God's first provision for man was to give him food to eat (Gen. 1:29). God does not want man to merely admire or to study Christ; that would be akin to studying a steak, but not actually eating it. In order to truly experience Christ as life, one needs to eat Christ, digest Christ, and assimilate Christ. 

## Biblical Basis

Just like in real life, one lives spiritually by eating (John 6:57).

## Practice


## Issues

Eating requires digestion before the food is assimilated. One must be keen to the digestive process. After consuming biblical content, one must continue to muse upon and fellowship with the Lord regarding such things so that the food can be properly digested.
