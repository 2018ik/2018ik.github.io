## Background

**Eating** is the way through which God becomes one with man. God's first provision for man was to give him food to eat (Gen. 1:29). God does not want man to merely admire or to study Christ; that would be akin to studying a steak, but not actually eating it. In order to truly experience Christ as life, one needs to eat Christ, digest Christ, and assimilate Christ. There is a principle in the Bible that "you are what you eat." Partaking of God makes a person one with God, while partaking of the world i.e. material enjoyments makes a person one with the world (1 Cor. 10:21).

Actually, Christ is the reality of all eating. Eating without realizing that Christ is the reality of all the food is in a sense, idolatry.

## Biblical Basis

Just like in real life, one lives spiritually by eating (John 6:57).

In chapter 2 of Song of Songs, the Lord Jesus is likened to apples. Then, later in the book, the lover of Christ is said to a noise with the fragrance of apples (S.S. 7:8). As the lover of Christ was constituted with apples by eating apples, believers today are constituted with Christ by eating Christ.

## Practice


## Issues

Eating requires digestion before the food is assimilated. One must be keen to the digestive process. After consuming biblical content, one must continue to muse upon and fellowship with the Lord regarding such things so that the food can be properly digested.
