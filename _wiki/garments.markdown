## Background

**Garments** in the Bible signify one's daily walk and living, that is the virtue of one's human behavior.

## Biblical Basis

Isaiah 64:6 describes human righteousness like that of filthy rags. Revelation 19:8 describes fine linen as the righteousness deeds of the saints. Thus, garments as something which one adorns themselves with and can be outwardly seen denotes one's daily walk, living, and deportment.

## Examples

### Daughter of Tyre

The first garment corresponds to objective righteousness, having the divine nature of gold. The second garment corresponds to subjective righteousness, as she is now being led to the king to be married (Psa. 45:13-14). This typifies the wedding feast of Christ and the church in the millennium.

### Priestly Garments

The priestly garment in the OT had fringes on the borders on which a cord of blue could be placed. A blue cord is a heavenly binding. Hence, as people of God, we should be under the binding, that ist he ruling of the heavenly government.

### Lord's Garments

In particular, the garments of the Lord Jesus signify His perfect humanity or human virtuous perfection. The Lord's human virtue contains the healing power, thus, when a sick woman touched the fringe of His garment, she was healed (Matt. 9:20-22).
