## Examples

| Example | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Daughter of Tyre (Psa. 45:13-14) | The first garment corresponds to objective righteousness, having the divine nature of gold. The second garment corresponds to subjective righteousness, as she is now being led to the king to be married. This typifies the wedding feast of Christ and the church in the millennium. |
