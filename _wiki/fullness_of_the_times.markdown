## Background

The **fullness of the times** in Ephesians 1:10 refers to the completion of all the ages, the dispensations. In the current age of grace, God is making known His will so that He can close the age, consummating in the New Jerusalem.  

## Significance

God widens the dispensing of Himself in size and element throughout the ages, beginning with Adam, through Moses, through the apostles, to now. This dispensing will become even wider during the dispensation of the kingdom. Finally, the last dispensation is of "the fullness of the times." This is the ultimate consummation of God's dispensing work.
