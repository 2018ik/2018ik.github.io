## Background

The work is the Body seeking increase. Physically speaking, this is preaching the gospel and building up churches. But there is no plan, mission board, or human methodology in this process; there is no marketing, administrative skill or promotions. The work is fully by the mingled spirit.

Since the reality of the work is the Body of Christ, carrying out the work in oneness requires seeing that there is only one work, the work of the Body.

## Relationship to the church

The work directly produces the church, which indirectly produces the work (through the ministry).
