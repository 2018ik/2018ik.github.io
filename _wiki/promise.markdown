### Testimony #1

>Galatians 3:16 says "your seed who is Christ." It's very, very clear Christ is the seed. And then there's also the promise of the land which is the all-inclusive Christ. And so when I was reading Galatians 3:14 and it talks about the blessing of Abraham might come to the gentiles in Christ Jesus; that's very clear, but then it says that the promise is the Spirit. It is not Christ, it's the Spirit. I was considering why this is and the life study helps because it explains why it is: it's because Christ is the Spirit and without the Spirit we cannot subjectively and experientially enter in to being the seed of Abraham to experience and enjoy Christ as the all-inclusive good land. This is why the Spirit is such a blessing and why it's the total blessing of the gospel. It's because through our having the Spirit in us and enjoying and experiencing it we can enter into this all-inclusive good land we can enter into everything God accomplished for us did for us has had will do everything we can enter into all of that through the Spirit. Praise the Lord!
