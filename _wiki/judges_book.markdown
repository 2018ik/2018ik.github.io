## Background

The book of **Judges** reveals the reign of judges over the children of Israel. The need of the judges was due to the generation of Joshua, who knew Jehovah and His works, had passed and a new evil generation who served the Baals and forsook Jehovah commenced (Judg. 2:10-12). This was a matter of the generation's attitude. Evidently, their fathers recounted who Jehovah was and His wondrous deads (Judg. 6:13), but the generation under the judges intentionally forsook Him despite having this knowledge.

## Significance

The factor to maintaining a proper standing in the good land, that is, in the church, is for one's knowing and experiencing of God and His works to govern their living.
