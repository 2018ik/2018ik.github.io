## Background

A **martyr** (Greek: witness), is someone who lays down their life for the Lord. The martyr's blood is the seed of the gospel. The Lord wants us all to be martyrs, if not physical at least psychologically.

## Significance

> I remember being very inspired by the stories of people willing to pay the ultimate price for the Lord's name. Even before I was saved, these stories were so motivational. Don't you want to be with those who are willing to give everything to the Lord? This is one of those things which on one hand kind of intimidated me at first but also attracted by to the Lord's Recovery. I could be with a group of people who are willing to face rejection and be despised and would yet follow Christ. We have a heritage of brothers who paid the ultimate price of sacrifice for the Lord's sake. Martyrs are most admirable and something we should all aspire to. If we are willing to give everything to Him and put everything on the altar, we may not get the promotion, we may suffer rejection, but if we have the heart to give everything to Christ the Lord has the ground to honor us. And this causes us to be faithful unto death.
