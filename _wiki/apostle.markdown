## Background

An **apostle** is someone sent by God with His authority to preach the gospel, teach the divine truth, and to establish churches. *Apostle* is the anglicized Greek word that means “one who is sent.” This is a gift given by God, and cannot be attained by man's self-effort (Eph. 4:11). Every proper believer is a sent one. 

## History

In the early church, the twelve apostles played a particular role as those who directly witnessed the life of Jesus (Acts 1:21), and according to the number of disciples originally ordained by Jesus. To replace Judas, they cast lots for a replacement for the 12th member (Acts 1:26). However, as long as the Lord's move continues, the choosing of apostles will also continue. Paul and Barnabas were recognized as apostles (Acts 14:14), and there were many more recognized as apostles who were not directly named (1 Cor. 15:7). Many also declared themselves apostles though they were not (Rev. 2:2), indicating that the apostleship is a dynamic role based on God's calling, not simply the original twelve.
