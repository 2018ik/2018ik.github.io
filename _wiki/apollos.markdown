## Background

**Apollos** was a preacher and was very eloquent and powerful in the Scriptures (Acts 18:24), but he had many opinions contrary to the apostle Paul and God's NT economy. At first in Acts 18, he was only aware of the baptism of John, before being taught more accurately by Aquila and Priscilla (Acts 18:24-28). However, even after receiving this help, he likely did not change his ways. In Acts 19, Paul nonetheless had to correct the Ephesian believers as they were still only aware of John's baptism. This shows that it is not very easy to drop one's old ways and preferences.

Paul had urged Apollos many times to go to the church in Corinth, but he refused to go (1 Cor. 16:12).
