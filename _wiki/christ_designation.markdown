## Background

Christ was **designated** the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of Holiness out of the resurrection of the dead (Rom. 1:4). Prior to this designation, Christ possessed both human and divine natures, however His human nature had yet to be elevated into divinity. 

The most definitive proof that His human nature, that is His flesh, had yet to elevate into divinity prior to resurrection is the fact that He died. The divine, uncreated life cannot die. Therefore, His flesh did not have the divine life.

This designation was an altogether organic process; Jesus was not legally designated the Son of God, but begotten through the Spirit's imparting of divine life to His mortal body (Rom. 8:11).

## Significance

The designation of Christ is to make Him the firstborn Son of God with the consummated mingling of divinity and humanity as the prototype for His mass reproduction in the believers. As His children grow in life, eventually they too are designated sons of God.
