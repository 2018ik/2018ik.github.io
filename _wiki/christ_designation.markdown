## Background

Christ was **designated** the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of Holiness out of the resurrection of the dead (Rom. 1:4). Prior to this designation, Christ was born to be the Son of Man, possessing both human and divine natures, however His human nature had yet to be elevated into divinity. From eternity, Christ was the only-begotten Son of God becoming divinity. Through incarnation, He acquired another element called humanity in His human flesh. In His flesh, He was not the Son of God because it lacked the divine nature. 

In 1 Peter 3:18, on the one hand He was put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the Spirit. In the eyes of God, the death and resurrection of Christ took place simultaneously, just like how the shell of a grain of wheat breaks and the life-germ is made alive simultaneously. From the time the Lord Jesus expired, the Spirit of Holiness in His Spirit was enlivened with new power to pervade the human flesh of the crucified Jesus, and eventually on the third day when the Lord resurrected from the dead, the human flesh of Jesus was fully permeated with the Spirit. Now, a human being as become God, opening the way for many sons of man to become sons of God.

The most definitive proof that His human nature, that is His flesh, had yet to elevate into divinity prior to resurrection is the fact that He died. The divine, uncreated life cannot die. Therefore, His flesh did not have the divine life.

This designation was an altogether organic process; Jesus was not legally designated the Son of God, but begotten through the Spirit's imparting of divine life to His mortal body (Rom. 8:11).

## Significance

The designation of Christ is to make Him the firstborn Son of God with the consummated mingling of divinity and humanity as the prototype for His mass reproduction in the believers. As His children grow in life, eventually they too are designated sons of God.
