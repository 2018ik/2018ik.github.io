>"How sweet are your words to my taste! Sweeter han honey to my mouth!"

\- Psalm 119:103 

## Background

How many of our irl relationships are "sweet?" Can you claim that your interactions with your family or the saints are "sweet?" Likewise, when we come the Lord, we have some kind of relationship, but is it sweet?

Our morning revival can change something bitter, into something sweet. There are a lot of things in our being, background and culture about God which can hinder us having a sweet relationship with the Lord. For example, we may not often say "I love you," or say it in a formal way. Likewise, we may often have an improper posture. The way we act or think may not match with the Lord. Therefore, we need to apply the death of Christ to deal with all of these things which prevent us from coming in openness. In fact, even the death of Christ itself is sweet.

This is also a two way transaction: our musing should likewise be sweet to Jehovah (Psa. 104:34).
