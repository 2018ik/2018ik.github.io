## Background

Our appearance and conduct must be proper; this means there is the mark of resurrection and the mark of the Holy Spirit. Others should look at us and know that we are believers and that we have been marked out by God.

## Appearance

Our appearance should not draw attention to ourselves. This way, our appearance does not detract or distract from our speaking.

### Clothing

Clothes should be neat and orderly. The principle of clothing is to be covered in a proper way.

### Living Space

## Conduct

### Address

The way we address others should be respectful. We should greet one another. 

### Driving

Be a safe driver. As a passenger, consider proactively offering to pay for gas.
