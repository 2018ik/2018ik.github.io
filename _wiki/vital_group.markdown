## Background

A **vital group** is a group of living and active Christians who meet together to perfect and build up the church according to [the way that God has ordained](../god_ordained_way) in Acts. Not only so, but vital groups are all the ultimate substantiation of the vision of Christ and the church given to the Lord's Recovery. It is through vital groups that the saints are perfected to build up the Body of Christ to bring the Lord back. Believers who are vital are gathered together despite persecution to continue steadfastly and desperately in prayer and praise.

There are many groups of Christians to meet together, but these groups are rarely vital. The church is degraded, and has become abnormal, even since the early church throughout Paul's epistles. Satan's strategy is to bring in many replacements for Christ; instead of Christ himself, believers are often more interested in Bible knowledge, carrying out good works, and trying to do good things. The enemy has also annulled the function of the members of the Body of Christ. Instead of all the members functioning as priests to God, there are intermediate members (e.g. clergy) through which the members communicate to God by proxy. Lastly, the enemy has brought in division, which is quite apparent today with the many denominations of Christianity.

All of these aforementioned things are *not* normal - therefore to be vital is simply to be a normal Christian: no replacements for Christ, direct contact with God, and to have the proper oneness. Such normal Christians are actually overcomers. The relationship of vital groups to the church is equal to the relationship of the types of Zion (the overcomers) to Jerusalem (all believers). 

## Why "Vital" Groups?

To be "vital" means to be living and active. It's easy to get into teaching, into doctrine, but without the divine life, such things are dead works. Therefore, to be vital is to be contrary to these dead works: to be living and active. We have to look to the Lord's mercy and grace desperately to vitalize ourselves and others.

The purpose of vital groups is to increase, perfect, and build up the Body of Christ. These are groups of two or three which are gathered into the Lord's name (Matt. 18:20). Notice that "gathered" here is passive voice; the subject which is performing the gathering is the Lord Himself.

The source of the vital groups is life, not human organization and management. Similarly, the nature of the vital groups is spiritual, to be filled with the Holy Spirit. There are many means by which people can be gained, but if the source is not life and the nature of the work is not of the Holy Spirit then the work will not last. If people are brought in based on natural, [leavened](../leaven) means, then the integrity of the Lord's Recovery will be impacted.

The condition of the vital groups is loving one another (John 13:35) in oneness and with one accord. In order to express the divine life and to bear fruit, the branches (that is, the believers) must love one other (John 15:12-17). If there is no spirit and no love, it is only possible to gather in a natural way - socializing rather than blending.

Without love, everything we do related to the vital groups is in vain. Love builds up (1 Cor. 8:1), is not jealous, is not provoked, does not take account of evil, covers all things, endures all things, never falls away, and is the greatest (1 Cor. 13:4-8, 13). This is foundational for the aforementioned purpose and nature of the vital groups.

## Acts 2:46-47

In these two verses, we see six descriptions of what vital groups do:

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Day by day | Not once a week, or once a month. Every day, we need to look for opportunities to preach the gospel. |
| Continuing steadfastly with one accord | |
| Breaking bread from house to house | Breaking bread was a day by day matter. Although it would be best for a new one to attend the Lord's day meeting, if it does not fit in their schedule, we can be flexible to break bread with them on other days to meet their need. |
| Partook of their food with exultation and simplicity of heart | |
| Praising God and having grace with all | |
| The Lord added together those who were being saved | This is the building up of the Body. |

Unbelievers observe these six things and innately desire them; people want to have the kind of community that is only possible in the Body of Christ, out of the divine life and divine love (John 15:7). As a result, they are drawn to God, who is added to them. This is the increase gained by the vital groups. 

## Application

Vital groups cannot be formed by organization. Although it seems like organizing the groups based on language, neighborhood, etc. would form groups a lot faster, a group will only be vital if it is formed organically through desperate prayer. 

In order to be vital, we have to take care of fellowship, intercession, mutual care and shepherding. These four things should be done in a very spontaneous way, and begins with fellowship, which begins with contacting the Lord in prayer. Then, we can fellowship with others to get to know their situation. Then, we can pray to intercede for one another. This prayer will lead to a mutual care for one another, which is expressed through shepherding - the physical rendering of help. Even if there is an unrepentant brother who offended the church who has been set aside in the fellowship, a vital group is one that continues to pray for them, that they may eventually be restored (2 Cor. 7:6-13)

We must drop our opinions and be open, in order to enter into the practice of the vital groups. We have to come together, pray, open to one another and seek the Lord that we can be blended as a group. Otherwise it's going to be difficult to have much impact with anyone.
