## Background

A person's **environment** are the outward aspects of their life which are sovereignly arranged by God to draw them closer to Him. Oftentimes one sees a suboptimal environment to be unfair, but actually it is God's mercy that they can be exposed. The vert fact that someone would complain about an environment shows that they still consider themselves as something; all such dissatisfaction comes from hidden self-love.
