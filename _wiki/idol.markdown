## Background

Idols are anything that one loves more than the Lord, and anything that replaces the Lord in their lives. Not just pictures on the wall or statues, but Ezekiel 14:3 says "these people have set up idols in their hearts." There can be something in the heart which replaces the Lord.

## Biblical Examples

1. Golden Calf
