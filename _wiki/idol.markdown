## Background

Idols are anything that one loves more than the Lord, and anything that replaces the Lord in their life. These are not just pictures on the wall or statues, as Ezekiel 14:3 says "these people have set up idols in their hearts." There can be many inherently unsinful and common things in the heart which replace the Lord. Idolatry is Satan's usurping of what God has given His chosen people in order to make it a waste. 

## Five Principles

There are five principles of idolatry: 1 cause, 2 definitions and 2 descriptions.

1. Self-beautification/self-expression leads to idolatry. God is supposed to the beauty of the church (Isa. 60:7; Eph. 5:26-27) and the expression of the self undermines the expression of God. When a person speaks and preaches for God, they should not seek out their own glory or financial gain, but have a pure desire to serve God.
2. Idolatry is Satan's usurping of What God has given to make it a waste. God gives His people many things, and these things can be misused for self-gain.
3. Idolatry is the worship of enjoyable things that are fun. In 1 Corinthians, Paul said that the Israelites became idolaters, sitting down to eat and drink and standing up to play. To *play* here implies a lack of seriousness, and with the intention to have fun. This is in contrast to real enjoyment of Christ.
4. With idolatry there is the pretense of worshipping the true God (Exo. 32:4-6; 1 Kings 12:26-30).
5. With idolatry there is mixture in worship (Exo. 32:4-6; 1 Cor. 3:12)
