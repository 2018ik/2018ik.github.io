## Background

Idols are anything that we love more than the Lord, and anything that replaces the Lord in our lives. Not just pictures on the wall or statues, but In Ezekiel 14:3, he says "these people have set up idols in their hearts" which means idols can be in our hearts. There can be something in our hearts which replaces the Lord in our lives. 

To guard ourselves from idols is to not allow anything or anyone to come in and replace the Lord in our lives.
