## Background

The **life-giving Spirit** is an aspect of the Holy Spirit which denotes its function to reach regenerated believers in order to give them life. Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit through His resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45). The verb *became* in 1 Corinthians 15:45 indicates that this life-giving aspect was not always there. This is an economical change which the Spirit went through upon Christ’s resurrection, and only after resurrection could the Spirit indwell man and give life to man. The significance of Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit is one of the greatest truths recovered in the 20th century.

Although the element of the Spirit is life, this life in a vacuum cannot do anything for man. Thus, Christ had to become the life-giving Spirit to dispense Himself into His chosen and redeemed people. For example, bread may contain all the nutrients to sustain life, but bread sitting by itself on a table can’t be considered life-giving bread. However, when someone eats the bread and begins digesting it, at that moment, the nutrients are being distributed into that person and thus the bread is now giving life. This life-giving Spirit which indwells man is spiritual food and gives life to man, that man’s entire being can be fully assimilated with Christ as its content.

## Significance

The life-giving Spirit is the essence and reality of the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:13). As the blood is the essence of a physical body, if the Spirit is removed from the Body, it becomes a corpse. The life-giving Spirit is what builds up the churches into the organism of the Body of Christ, by transforming the local churches into the image of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem as the eternal enlargement and expression of God.

## Biblical Basis

1 Corinthians 15:45 says that last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. The context of the chapter indicates clearly this becoming was a result of resurrection. The previous verse 44 speaks of a soulish body being raised as a spiritual body. This resurrected body is spiritual because it is saturated by the Spirit, which can now indwell man as a result of resurrection.

John 7:39 says the Spirit was not yet, as Jesus had yet to be glorified. The glorification of Christ refers to His passing through death and resurrection to be [designated the Son of God in power](../christ_designation). John 14:16-17 speaks of another Comforter also called the Spirit of reality which will be *in* the disciples. The life-giving Spirit which indwells man is the fulfillment of this prophecy. 

## All-Inclusive

### Human Elements

Everything of Christ, who He is, what He is, is all embodied in the Spirit. When we touch the Bible to receive Christ the person, we receive not only the divine but also the human. We start to exhibit the human elements of humility, patience, etc.

Not only is God great and almighty, but He is also humble; He was manifested as a slave to serve man. However, the Spirit does not work in us to strengthen our own humility, but it dispenses Christ's humility into us, which becomes an expression of an attribute of God in our human virtues.
