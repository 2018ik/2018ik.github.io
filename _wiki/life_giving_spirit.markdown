## Background

## Significance

The life-giving Spirit is the essence and reality of the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:13). As the blood is the essence of a physical body, if the Spirit is removed from the Body, it becomes a corpse.

## All-Inclusive

### Human Elements

Everything of Christ, who He is, what He is, is all embodied in the Spirit. When we touch the Bible to receive Christ the person, we receive not only the divine but also the human. We start to exhibit the human elements of humility, patience, etc.

Not only is God great and almighty, but He is also humble; He was manifested as a slave to serve man. However, the Spirit does not work in us to strengthen our own humility, but it dispenses Christ's humility into us, which becomes an expression of an attribute of God in our human virtues.
