## Background

The **universal church** is the one church consisting of all saved believers throughout history and is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23). This is the church that is spoken of in Matthew 16:18, where Jesus spoke of the rock referring to Himself, upon which He would build the church. 

The Body of Christ emphasizes an organic, bodily growth with Christ as the Head (Eph. 4:15-16), while universal church emphasizes a building of precious materials with Christ as the foundation (1 Cor. 3:11-12).

The practical expression of the one universal church is in the local church of a particular city.
