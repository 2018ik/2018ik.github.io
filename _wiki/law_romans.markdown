## Background

Romans chapters 7 to 8 reveals four **laws** which operate within man, as well as the law of God. The four laws which operate in man are not legalistic or written laws, but scientific laws i.e. principles which operate automatically based on certain conditions.

## Law of God

>So then the law is holy, and the commandment holy and righteous and good.

\- Rom. 7:12

The law of God in Romans 7:2, 7:7, 7:12, 7:21, and many previous chapters portrays who God is as love, light, holiness and righteousness. This is the same the Old Testament law.

## Laws in man

The relationship between these four laws is as follows: when one sees the requirements of the law of God, the law of good in their mind will desire to serve to fulfill the law of God. However, this triggers the law of sin and of death which causes them to fail; to do good in the mind always leads to sin and death (Rom. 7:25). However, there is a divine "switch" in the human spirit, which when switched on (i.e. Roman 8:6 - the mind is *set* on the spirit), the law of the Spirit of life will spontaneously activate to impart life, peace and fulfill the law of God.

In other words, the law of sin and of death can be likened to gravity, always bringing everything to the ground. The law of good in the mind can be likened to one's vain effort to hold an object up, suppose to lift a 20lb dumbbell. A person may be able to carry this for hours or days, but inevitably, gravity will win. On the other hand, the law of the Spirit of life is like being placed on a jumbo jet in the air. There is no self-effort involved, the jet simply flies against gravity. However, one can constantly transition between these three laws all the time. The goal is to continually live Christ according to the law of the Spirit of life.

### Law of good (Rom. 7:23)

>But I see a different law in my members, warring against the **law of my mind** and making me a captive to the law of sin which is in my members.

\- Rom. 7:23

This law is present in one's mind and desires to do good to fulfill the law of God (Rom. 7.18). This is based on the life given to man when they were initially created present in man prior to the fall. After the fall, a second life was added to man - the Satanic life of sin and of death which operates based on its corresponding law.

### Law of sin and of death

> For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the **law of sin and of death**.

\- Rom. 8:2

This law in one's flesh is stronger than the law of good in their mind (Rom. 7:23). While a person can make the resolution to do good, this law of sin and of death will inevitably overcome them and cause them to fail.

### The law of the Spirit of life

> For the **law of the Spirit of life** has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.

\- Rom. 8:2

This law is based on the divine life of God received by man when he is regenerated. This is the most powerful law which overcomes the law of sin and of death. By turning to our spirit, this law spontaneously activates, and allows one to fulfill the law of God. This law is actually just the Triune God Himself.

### The law "that"

> I find then **the law**, with me who wills to do the good, that is the evil is present with me.

\- Rom. 7:21

This is principle underlying the fact that the law of sin and of death overcomes the law of good of the mind. Whenever Paul wills to do good, he inevitably finds the evil present with him.

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

> The dog has a life. That dog has a law of that life, the life of a dog. This creature needs a certain food to subsist, and it requires companionship. Thus, they bark and express the dog life. Conversely, the cat life has its law for life. It needs a different food to survive, and a cat has absolutely no need for companionship. And they don't bark, they meow. It's a different life with a different expression. This has a biblical basis - can a leopard change his spots (Jer. 13:23)? Can a fig tree produce olives (James 3:12)?
