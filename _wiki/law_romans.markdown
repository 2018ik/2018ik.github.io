## Background

Romans chapters 7 to 8 reveals four laws which operate within man, as well as the law of God, which is just the written Mosaic law that expresses God. 

## Law of God

The law of God in Romans 7:2, 7:7, 7:12, 7:21, and many previous chapters portrays who God is as love, light, holiness and righteousness. This is the same the Old Testament law.

## Laws in man

These are not legalistic or written laws, but "scientific laws" i.e. principles which operate automatically and are fundamental truths. For example, the law of gravity is always working at all times.

### Law of good (Rom. 7:23)

This law is present in one's mind and desires to do good to fulfill the law of God.

### Law of sin and of death (Rom. 7:23)

This law in one's flesh is stronger than the law of good in their mind. While a person can make the resolution to do good, this law of sin and of death will inevitably overcome them and cause them to fail.

### The law of the Spirit of life

This law is installed in man's spirit, and this is the most powerful law which overcomes the law of sin and of death. By turning to our spirit, this law spontaneously activates, and allows one to fulfill the law of God. This law is actually just the Triune God Himself.

### The law "that" (Rom. 7:21)

This is principle underlying the fact that the law of sin and of death overcomes the law of good of the mind. Whenever Paul wills to do good, he inevitably finds the evil present with him.
