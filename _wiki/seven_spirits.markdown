## Background

The **seven Spirits** (or **sevenfold intensified Spirit**) seen in Revelation 1:4, 4:5 and 5:6 is for the completion of the age and the consummation of God's building work throughout history. When the Lord was on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, He did everything by the Spirit, but the Spirit was one. By the age of Revelation, this Spirit was now "seven Spirits." This doesn't mean that there are now seven Spirits in count, but that the Spirit was intensified sevenfold. 

In Revelation 1:4-5, the ordering of the Trinity is the Father, seven Spirits, and Son rather than the usual Father, Son, and Spirit seen in Matthew 28. The change in ordering indicates an intensified function in the Spirit, and that it is needed for calling the overcomers out of degradation for the closing of the age. Seven signifies completion, as seen in the seven seals, seven trumpets, seven bowls, seven days, and seven years.

The Spirit's sevenfold-intensification is to deal with the degradation of the churches seen in Revelation chapters 2 and 3 as well as today, and to produce the overcomers to build the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem. 

## Biblical Basis

There is a progressive revelation of the seven Spirits throughout the OT that is made clear in the book of Revelation. First there is the lampstand with seven lamps, followed by the seven eyes of the stone, followed by the seven Spirits. All of these instances of seven things are for God's building, whether physically in the OT or spiritually in the NT. This corresponds to God's eternal goal of obtaining a house for Himself (Isa. 66:1-2).

### Seven Lamps

In Exodus 25:37 there is a lampstand with seven lamps. In Hebrews there is a true tabernacle in the heavens; this is what Moses based his physical tabernacle on. The lampstand generates light to practically allow the tabernacle to be build up and used. If there is not lampstand in the Holy Place, it would be difficult to move around. Therefore, the seven lamps are for God's move, which is for His building. The same lampstand is seen again during the time of David in the temple, and the same principle applies there (1 Kings 7:49).

### Seven Eyes

In Zechariah 3:9, 4:2, 4:10, the seven lamps are the seven eyes of the stone, which in 4:10 are also called the eyes of Jehovah. During this period, the temple was being rebuilt, once again demonstrating a relation between the seven eyes and God's building. Particularly, Zechariah 3:9 notes that the the eyes are upon a stone that is engraved. A stone or rock is a symbol in the OT for Christ and is evidenced by the engraving on the rock which signifies His crucifixion. The seven eyes on the rock therefore corresponds directly to the seven eyes of the Lamb, as seen in Revelation 5:6. 

### Seven Spirits

The relation between the seven lamps, seven eyes and seven Spirits is finally brought together in the book of Revelation with the seven Spirits as the seven eyes of the redeeming Lamb. We know these are not seven Spirits in count because although there are seven lamps, there is one lampstand. Similarly the seven eyes are possessed by a single stone or Lamb. Furthermore, it is "the Spirit" speaking to the churches (2:7). There is also a very clear biblical principle of the Spirit being one (Eph. 4:4). Hence, the seven Spirits can be called the "sevenfold intensified Spirit."

The seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven Spirits "of" the Son. According to doctrine, the Son and Spirit are two individuals, but according to experience, they are one. Just as a person and his eyes are one, so is the Lamb and its seven eyes. If a person points their gaze at someone, you may say "this person is looking at a him." However, you would not say "this person's eyes are looking at him." When the Spirit reaches us, it is Christ looking at us. When the Spirit transfuses all that He is to us, it is Christ being added to us. 

## Function

Based on the context of the degraded churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the seven Spirits were to call out overcomers from these churches. On one hand, the Spirit administrates over the world situation, that is the unbelievers. On the other hand, the Spirit carries out God's NT economy by infusing itself into the believers.

### Burning Lamps

As the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne (Rev. 4:5), the seven Spirits are sent forth into all the earth (Rev. 5:6) to direct the world situation. The earth is judged, purified and refined by the lamps of fire which produces pure golden lampstands (churches) which shine in the dark age (Mal. 3:3). This is to burn away anything which is searched out to not match God. The entire world is under the burning of this flame. All of the world leaders and people in positions of power are under the burning of the seven lamps.

Notice that despite all the references to burning and fire throughout Revelation, there is no fire in the New Jerusalem. This is because the function of fire to consummate the New Jerusalem is already complete. The verse prior to the one mentioning the seven lamps of fire mentions 24 elders on 24 thrones; this is also mentioned in the Old Testament with David. 

### Searching Eyes

As the seven eyes of the lamb, the seven Spirits infuse all that God is to the believers to build up the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem (God's economy). The emphasis on the eyes is a personal infusing of the element of Christ and the purging of natural things The emphasis on the burning is to produce produce a uniform corporate Body that is the same as God in essence and appearance. The description of God on the throne and the New Jerusalem show that both are like jasper (Rev. 4:3; Rev. 21:11).

### Speaking 

The Spirit speaks to all of the churches. At the beginning of each letter to the churches, it is the Lord Jesus speaking (Rev 2:1) but at the end it is the Spirit (Rev. 2:7). The pneumatic Christ as the consummated Spirit and the totality of the Triune God is speaking in both cases. As the Spirit does not speak to individual believers, its purpose is to build up the *churches* in the midst of their degradation. Spending time before the seven lamps and the seven eyes no doubt contributes to the building up of the Body, as the searching and burning will tear down the self, which is the biggest hindrance to the building.

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

The seven eyes of the Lamb are for God's building. This is not a sevenfold-intensified redemption. The seven eyes represent the sevenfold intensified Spirit which builds the New Jerusalem, God's consummate house. We see in Exodus that the lampstand with its seven lamps is for the enlightening of the tabernacle, God's initial building. In 1 Kings the same lampstand is in the temple. Then in Zechariah, the seven eyes on the engraved stone is for the rebuilding of the temple. Finally, there is a slain lamb standing with seven eyes, and seven Spirits in book of Revelation. This is a progressive revelation, revealing that the seven lamps and seven eyes are figurative portraits of the seven Spirits which is for God's building. 

The seven Spirit's two primary functions is illustrated by the lamps and eyes. The burning lamps are for enlightening, searching, exposing, judging, and burning. Imagine a room full of dirty objects (i.e. your heart). We light up the room that we may see, then search, then expose, judge and burn away all that does not belong in the room. After the room is purified in this way, the seven eyes are for watching, observing, infusing, and transfusing. This adds God's element into us in place of what has been burnt away. In experience, the burning and transfusing takes place simultaneously as part of metabolic transformation.
