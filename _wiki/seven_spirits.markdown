## Background

The **seven Spirits** (or sevenfold intensified Spirit) seen in Revelation 1:4, 4:5 and 5:6 is for the completion of the age and consummating God's purpose. When the Lord was on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, He did everything by the Spirit, but the Spirit was one. By the age of Revelation, this Spirit was now "seven Spirits." This doesn't mean that there are now seven Spirits in count, but that the Spirit was intensified sevenfold. This intensification was to deal with the degradation of the churches seen in Revelation chapters 2 and 3, and to produce the overcomers to build the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem. 

## Biblical Basis

In Exodus 25:37 there is a lampstand with seven lamps. In Hebrews there is a true tabernacle in the heavens; this is what Moses based his physical tabernacle on. In Zechariah 3:9, 4:2, 4:10, the seven lamps are the seven eyes of the stone. This relation between the seven lamps, seven eyes and seven Spirits is finally brought together in the book of Revelation with the seven Spirits.

We know these are not seven Spirits in count because although there are seven lamps, there is one lampstand; although there are seven eyes, there is one stone. Furthermore, it is "the Spirit" speaking to the churches (2:7). There is also a very clear biblical principle of the Spirit being one (Eph. 4:4). Hence, the seven Spirits can be called the "sevenfold intensified Spirit."

In Revelation 1:4-5, the ordering of the Trinity is the Father, seven Spirits, and Son rather than the usual Father, Son, and Spirit seen in Matthew 28. The change in ordering indicates an intensified function in the Spirit, and that it is needed for calling the overcomers out of degradation for the closing of the age. Seven signifies completion, as seen in the seven seals, seven trumpets, seven bowls, seven days, and seven years.

## Function

### Overcome Degradation

Based on the context of the degraded churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the seven Spirits were to call out overcomers from these churches. Paul, Peter and John wrote their epistles due to the degradation in the churches, particularly 2 Timothy, 2 Peter and the three Epistles of John. The degradation of the church began in the latter half of the first century and continues until today. 

### Divine Administration

As the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne (Rev. 4:5), the seven Spirits are sent forth into all the earth (Rev. 5:6) to direct the world situation. The earth is judged, purified and refined by the lamps of fire which produces pure golden lampstands (churches) which shine in the dark age (Mal. 3:3). This is to burn away anything which is searched out to not match God. The entire world is under the burning of this flame.

Notice that despite all the references to burning and fire throughout Revelation, there is no fire in the New Jerusalem. This is because the function of fire to consummate the New Jerusalem is already complete. The verse prior to the one mentioning the seven lamps of fire mentions 24 elders on 24 thrones; this is also mentioned in the Old Testament with David. 

### Divine Economy

As the seven eyes of the lamb, the seven Spirits infuse all that God is to the believers to build up the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem (God's economy). The Spirit speaks to the *churches* in Revelation, not to individual believers. The purpose of this intensified Spirit is to build up the churches in the midst of their degradation. Spending time before the seven lamps and the seven eyes no doubt contributes to the building up of the Body, as the searching and burning will tear down the self, which is the biggest hindrance to the building.

### Speaking 

The Spirit speaks to all of the churches. At the beginning of each letter to the churches, it is the Lord Jesus speaking (Rev 2:1) but at the end it is the Spirit (Rev. 2:7). The pneumatic Christ as the consummated Spirit and the totality of the Triune God is speaking in both cases.
