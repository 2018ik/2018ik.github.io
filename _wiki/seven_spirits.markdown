## Background

The **seven Spirits** (or sevenfold intensified Spirit) seen in Revelation 1:4, 4:5 and 5:6 is for the completion of the age and consummating God's purpose. The Spirit had to be intensified sevenfold to deal with the degradation of the churches seen in Revelation chapters 2 and 3, and to produce the overcomers to build the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem. The seven Spirits are burning before the throne (Rev. 4:5), indicating that this Spirit is for God's administration.

## Biblical Basis

In Exodus 25:37 there is a lampstand with seven lamps. In Hebrews there is a true tabernacle in the heavens; this is what Moses based his physical tabernacle on. In Zechariah 3:9, 4:2, 4:10, the seven lamps are the seven eyes of the stone. This relation between the seven lamps, seven eyes and seven Spirits is finally brought together in the book of Revelation.

In Revelation 1:4-5, the ordering of the Trinity is the Father, seven Spirits, and Son rather than the Father, Son, and Spirit seen in Matthew 28. The emphasis on the seven Spirits here in revelation is it is needed for the closing of the age. Seven signifies completion, as seen in the seven seals, seven trumpets, seven bowls, seven days, and seven years.

## Function

### Burning Lamps

As the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne (Rev. 4:5), the seven Spirits are sent forth into all the earth (Rev. 5:6) to carry out God's administration of judging, purifying and refining the earth to produce pure golden lampstands which shine in this current dark age (Mal. 3:3). This is to burn away anything which is searched out to not match God. The entire world is under the burning of this flame.

Notice that despite all the references to burning and fire throughout Revelation, there is no fire in the New Jerusalem. This is because the function of fire to consummate the New Jerusalem is already complete.

### Eyes of the Lamb

As the seven eyes of the lamb, the seven Spirits infuse all that God is to the believers. This is for the sake of building up the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem; the Spirit speaks to the *churches* in Revelation, not to individual believers. The purpose of this intensified Spirit is to build up the churches in the midst of their degradation. Spending time before the seven lamps and the seven eyes no doubt contributes to the building up of the Body, as the searching and burning will tear down the self, which is the biggest hindrance to the building.
