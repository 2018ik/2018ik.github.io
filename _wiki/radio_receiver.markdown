## Background

A radio receiver is often used as an analogy for the human spirit. 

## Analogy

God is omnipresent, that is He exists everywhere. However, much like radio waves, without the correct tool to detect and analyze the waves, it is as if they do not exist. The only way to detect the divine radio waves of God is through the human spirit, which functions as the receiving organ.

Suppose you travel back to medieval times with a modern-day radio transmitter. It is a fact that this transmitter can produce radio waves, but no one is going to believe that the radio waves exist because there is no way to detect them. Now suppose you give them a radio receiver, which can convert the radio waves to audio. Then, you go to a different building and broadcast your voice to them. Now they will be forced to believe. This is function of the human spirit: to receive the divine waves.
