## Background

Brands refer to marks branded on slaves to indicate their owners. However, Paul speaks of brands he bears in the name of Jesus (Gal 6:17). A life like the Lord Jesus' will be continually crucified (John 12:24); and Paul followed such a pattern. If we are faithful to live a crucified life according to the God-ordained way, opposition will rise up again and again. However, because we bear these brands, we enjoy peace and are not troubled by any situation of circumstances.
