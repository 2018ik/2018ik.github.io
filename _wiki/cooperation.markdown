## Background

The fulfillment of God's economy requires full man's cooperation, that man may live because of God (John 6:57). This is a fundamental principle of God's eternal will where He wanted God and man to be joined together through free choice, which is why man was placed in front of the tree of life to voluntarily partake (Gen 2:9). Therefore, man must cooperate with God to receive Him and be joined to Him.

The Christian race (Heb 12:1) is not a relay where one passes the baton off to God whenever they are in trouble, it is a race where the runner is one with God.

## Practical Steps

True cooperation is man working with God fully for His economy. The so-called "prosperity gospel" takes Christ for the sake of personal gain. This is to usurp God's purpose, as illustrated by the elders of Israel taking for themselves the Ark without God's leading (1 Sam 4:3). A prayer aligned with God's will was Hannah's.
