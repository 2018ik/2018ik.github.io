## Background

The **meal offering** in the Old Testament was fine flour mingled with oil and frankincense, which signifies humanity mingled with humanity.

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Fine flour | Principal component (Lev. 2:1). The other offerings are of the animal life, but this one is vegan. While the animal life is for redeeming, the vegetable life is for producing, generating. For the flour to be fine means it is perfectly even and balanced. Not just round and small, but perfectly even. E.g. some people are very emotional and some are very mental.  |
| Oil | Both mingled with fine flour and poured on top. Mingling = essential Spirit, poured on top = economical Spirit. We never get the humanity alone, they are distinct but inseparable.  |
| Frankincense | Typifies the aroma of resurrection. The only way to resurrection is through the cross Everything that Christ said went through the cross. |
| Salt | The cross. What is the basic factor of the covenant that God has made with us? The basic factor of our covenant in the NT is Christ was slain on the cross. This is also the prescription for leaven and honey which were strictly prohibited to be included in the meal offering (Lev. 2:11). It kills the leaven and the honey. We need to allow the Lord and cooperate with Him to salt our living. |

Leaven is not included in the meal offering because it typifies the evil things of the natural life which is not in Christ's humanity. It’s easy to see why the evil things can’t be in there. Worldliness, sinfulness, hatefulness are not in the humanity of Jesus. However, honey is also prohibited as it signifies the good things of the natural life.

For example, the Lord loved Lazarus but rather than immediately going to heal him, He checked with the Father. Then He went to resurrect Him. This is not natural love, but it bore the aroma of resurrection. On a long enough timeline, naturally good things eventually corrupt/ferment. For example in corporate living, if there is hate among the brothers it’s not the humanity of Jesus If there’s natural love among the brothers in corporate living, eventually, that’s worse and it ferments. The animosity and hatred that is there between two who used to love each other naturally surpasses two strangers. The enemy subtly uses the good natural things to damage the humanity of the believers.
