>"Seek first His Kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you"

\- Matt. 6:33

## Background

The **kingdom of God** is a realm where God can exercise his authority, which today is the church. Just as one is born into the household of God upon regeneration, they are also born into the kingdom of God (John 3:3-5). This is not a legal realm where papers and documents need to be signed in order to enter as in a sovereign nation, but an organic realm. Contrary to tradition, the kingdom is not just something in the future but is enterable today. The reality and appearance of the kingdom can be found on earth today, while the physical manifestation occurs during the millennium.

## Significance

The kingdom enables God to have the church. The proper church life is one that is lived in the reality of the kingdom (Rom. 14:17). For the sake of God's kingdom, He will add to us all these things (e.g. daily bread). These are things required for us to live the kingdom life, not everything which we desire out of our self.

## Church

The kingdom of God today is equal to the kingdom of the heavens and is the church. 

## Matthew

Matthew is the gospel of the kingdom, and reveals many aspects of the kingdom.

| Aspect | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Reality (chapters 5-7) | These chapters describe the reality of the kingdom on earth today. The kingdom people are those who are poor in spirit meek, merciful, pure in heart, not anxious about their daily needs etc. The kingdom law is also much higher than the Mosaic law; the righteousness of the kingdom people surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees (Matt. 5:20). |
| Appearance (chapter 13) | Alongside the reality, there is the appearance, or a false, leavened "kingdom" on earth today. The reality is symbolized as wheat while the false appearance is symbolized by tares. |
| Manifestation (chapters 24-25) | |

## Development

### Kingdom of God

The kingdom of God encompasses God's rule from eternity past to eternity future. Although the kingdom of God has always existed, man could not enter into it through regeneration until the dispensation of grace.

### Kingdom of the Heavens

Kingdom of the heavens is a term used exclusively by Matthew, indicating that it differs from the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God is God's general reign from eternity past to eternity future, and already existed in the Old Testament age (Matt. 21:34). However, the kingdom of the heavens is a subset of the kingdom of God which began with the dispensation of grace.

### Millennial Kingdom

This is the manifestation of the kingdom composed of believers whom Christ judges as overcomers at His second coming and is central to His kingdom ministry. Some claim that this millennial kingdom *is* the kingdom referred to by the Lord Jesus, and that the kingdom has been temporarily suspended in the age of grace. This is due to a misunderstanding of the reality of the kingdom and the manifestation of the kingdom. 

When the Bible speaks of "inheriting" the kingdom, that is something in the future, it is referring to the millennial kingdom. Inheriting this kingdom is a matter of overcoming, and is a matter of one's subjective righteousness (1 Cor. 6:9-10). On the other hand, *entering* the kingdom is a matter of objective righteousness, and is equivalent to being saved.
