>"Seek first His Kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you"

\- Matt. 6:33

## Background

The **kingdom of God** is a realm in which God can exercise his authority. This is not a legal realm, where papers and documents need to be signed in order to enter as in a sovereign nation, but an organic realm. The way to enter into the kingdom of God is to be born anew of the Spirit (John 3:3-5). The kingdom is not just something in the future; One can enter into the kingdom life today, and the prerequisite is regeneration.

## Significance

The kingdom enables God to have the church. The proper church life is one that is lived in the reality of the kingdom (Rom. 14:17). 
For the sake of God's kingdom, He will add to us all these things (e.g. daily bread). These are things required for us to live the kingdom life, not everything which we desire out of our self.

## Biblical Basis

### Matthew

Matthew is the gospel of the kingdom, and reveals many aspects of the kingdom. Those who are of the kingdom must have righteousness which surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees (Matt. 5:20). They must also do the will of the Father (Matt. 7:21). They also must be poor in spirit (Matt. 5:3), and are inevitably persecuted (Matt. 5:10).

## Aspects

### Kingdom of God

The kingdom of God encompasses God's rule from eternity past to eternity future. 

### Kingdom of the Heavens

Kingdom of the heavens is a term used exclusively by Matthew, indicating that it differs from the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God is God's general reign from eternity past to eternity future, and already existed in the Old Testament age (Matt. 21:34). However, the kingdom of the heavens is a subset of the kingdom of God which began with the dispensation of grace.

### Millennial Kingdom

This is the manifestation of the kingdom composed of believers whom Christ judges as overcomers at His second coming and is central to His kingdom ministry.
