## 7

The lover of Christ, having reached the stage of maturity is taking the initiative to go forth into the fields (S.S. 7:11). The fields signify the whole earth. The villages signify the totality of all the cities on earth. The vineyards are the local churches. Seeing if the vineyards are in bloom is a picture of us today taking care of our fruit, our new ones (S.S. 7:12). And she says - "there I will give you my love," indicating that working together with God and loving God go hand in hand.
