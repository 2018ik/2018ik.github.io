## Background

**Fellowship** (Greek: *koinomia*) is a common, joint and corporate participation between two paries in something. Fellowship implies a sense of traffic. In fact, the word used for "fellowship" in the Chinese Recovery Version Bible is "traffic." This can be illustrated by the power plant being the source of the electrical current or traffic to many homes. On one hand, there is a vertical fellowship between each home and the power plant, and on the other hand, there is a horizontal fellowship between each home, as they are all interconnected on the same grid. Likewise, a Christian must have both fellowship with God, as well as with the members of the Body (1 John 1:3).

In the scriptural sense, fellowship involves the issue and flow of the divine life. This fellowship is unique - there is only one life, one source, on Christ, one Spirit - thus there can only be one genuine fellowship of life. Staying in this fellowship is crucial for the Christian life. To be cut off from the fellowship, that is to no longer meet with or commune with the local believers, will inevitably result in spiritual death.

## Analogies

### Blood

The flow of life is constantly in motion, like the blood in our physical body. When we have uninterrupted fellowship, the flow circulates, and we are able to stay alive spiritually.
If the flow of blood stops, it clots. This can cause many issues (strokes, pulmonary embolism, etc.). We have to keep the blood flowing for our Body to function properly. The lack of flow results in detachment, death and darkness.

### Electricity

In an electrical circuit, the current must be switched on and kept flowing. If the flow stops, the circuit dies and stops functioning.

### River

The fellowship is the one unique flow in the Body of Christ, and is actually depicted in the New Jerusalem in Revelation 22. This river of water of life which proceeds out of the throne of God to the rest of the city (Rev. 22:1).

## Vertical Fellowship

We have fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ (1 John 1:3, 6). First thing in the morning, we should practice morning revival to spend time with the Lord to have fellowship with the Triune God directly.

## Horizontal Fellowship

We also have fellowship with one another (1 John 1:3, 7). This is the fellowship of the Body of Christ among the churches, and is equivalent to the fellowship of the apostles (Acts 2:42). This is not merely socializing, it is much higher. We are joined to God and he operates on a much higher plane. We should pray with one another. Prayer saves us from natural socialization.

Recall: the source of fellowship is the eternal life, and the Spirit in our spirit is the carrier of life. Accordingly, it is a "fellowship of the Holy Spirit" (2 Cor. 13:14). Therefore, if we are not in spirit we cannot have the proper fellowship. 

## Benefits

Fellowship supplies us with all the riches of the divine life. The divine flow in Revelation 22:1-2 is the tree of life, the supply. On the negative side, fellowship carries away and discharges "germs" in our inner being. 

There is a positive feedback loop here - getting into fellowship actually gets us further into the proper function; the divine life urges us to pray more, live for the Lord, and to speak in gatherings for the carrying out of God's Economy.

Fellowship is also the first step in the life cycle mentioned in John 1 and brings in God as light. Alternatively, you can say that we are brought into God who is light.
