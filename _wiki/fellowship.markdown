## Background

Fellowship is for worshipping, praying and rejoicing, and is a function of the human spirit. This brings in communion with God.

Fellowship implies a sense of traffic. In fact, the word used for "fellowship" in the Chinese Recovery Version Bible is "traffic." This can be illustrated by the power plant being the source of the electrical current or traffic. 

When we are brought into the fellowship, we not only have a vertical fellowship with God but also a horizontal fellowship with one another (1 John 1:3). These are two components of one fellowship. In order to have genuine fellowship, there must be both components.

This fellowship is unique - there is only one life, one source, on Christ, one Spirit - thus there can only be one genuine fellowship of life.

## The Flow

Fellowship is the fow of the eternal life; this life is constantly in motion, like the blood in our physical body. When we have uninterrupted fellowship, the flow circulates, and we are able to stay alive spiritually.

### Example of Blood

If the flow of blood stops, it clots. This can cause many issues (strokes, pulmonary embolism, etc.). We have to keep the blood flowing for our Body to function properly. The lack of flow results in detachment, death and darkness.

### Example of Electricity

In an electrical circuit, the current must be  switched on and kept flowing.

## Vertical Fellowship

We have fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ (1 John 1:3, 6). First thing in the morning, we should practice morning revival to spend time with the Lord to have fellowship with the Triune God directly.

## Horizontal Fellowship

We also have fellowship with one another (1 John 1:3, 7). This is not merely socializing, it is much higher. We are joined to God and he operates on a much higher plane. We should pray with one another. Prayer saves us from natural socialization.

Recall: the source of fellowship is the eternal life, and the Spirit in our spirit is the carrier of life. Accordingly, it is a "fellowship of the Holy Spirit" (2 Cor 13:14). Therefore, if we are not in spirit we cannot have the proper fellowship. 

## Benefits

Fellowship supplies us with all the riches of the divine life. The divine flow in Revelation 22:1-2 is the tree of life, the supply. On the negative side, fellowship carries away and discharges "germs" in our inner being. 

There is a positive feedback loop here - getting into fellowship actually gets us further into the proper function; the divine life urges us to pray more, live for the Lord, and to speak in gatherings for the carrying out of God's Economy.

Fellowship is also the first step in the life cycle mentioned in John 1 and brings in God as light. Alternatively, you can say that we are brought into God who is light.
