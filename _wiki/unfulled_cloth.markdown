## Background

An **unfulled cloth** is an unfinished or untreated cloth that still needs to go through a certain process. Thus, the unfolled cloth in Matthew 9:16 and Luke 5:36 refers to Christ in His human living prior to His consummation as the life-giving Spirit. This cloth can be applied to either an old garment or a new garment.

## Significance

To put an unfulled cloth on an old garment is to imitate what Christ was in His humanity without knowing or experiencing Him as the crucified and resurrected Christ. When we try to imitate Christ in our self-effort, it tears off our old man which inevitably fails to do so. The humanity of Christ can only be applied to a new garment, that is to be lived out by the new man.
