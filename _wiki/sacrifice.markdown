### Sacrifice

>when china was in danger by being overrun by the communist, brother nee decalred that he would send me out ofthe counry but otheres would remain to sacrifice themelves. after he said this I walked with him and asked why are you sending me away am i not worthy of being sacrificed. He replies yes we're willing to sacrifice ourselves while we look to the lord for Him to save us however there is the possiblity that one day the enemy will destroy us. If so, you will be out of the coutnry and we will still have a continunation. is it possible that brother lee that as he laid dying in the hospital was he considering this time with brother nee and the saccrifie that he made and is that why his last utterance was sacrifice.
