## Background

The **fall of man** is depicted in Genesis, where Satan as the serpent tempted Eve to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, who then shared the fruit with Adam. 

In the entire record of man's fall, the sole issue was that they failed to use their spirit to contact God. Rather than going to God, Adam and Eve exercised their soul: reasoning with the serpent in the mind, desiring the tree of knowledge in the emotion, and deciding to partake in the will.

Satan's words to Eve sowed a seed of doubt even before she partook of the fruit. 

Apparently man's fall was due to the serpent's outward temptation, but the intrinsic cause is the woman's assumption of the headship. She assumed it by speaking to the serpent without the covering of her husband. This response is most likely the first independent act recorded in the Bible. Eve should have simply stood on God's word and fled to God in her spirit.

"Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat ... but of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden you shall not eat of it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die."

Eve's recounting of the facts was fine, if not a bit inaccurate, but by responding she had already fell into the snare. This opened the way for the serpent to respond with a compelete falsehood: "you shall not surely die." First, the serpent questioned to sow seeds of doubt, and it ends with a direct contradiction to God's word. Surely the woman here was not using her spirit, she was engaging her mind.

Then, Satan posits that she would become like God, knowing good and evil. 

After this engagement, she partook of the fruit, and gave some to her husband. As a result, man's spirit was deadened.
