## Background

The **fall of man** is depicted in Genesis, where Satan as the serpent tempted Eve to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, who then shared the fruit with Adam. 

In the entire record of man's fall, the sole issue was that man failed to use their spirit to contact God. Rather than going to God, Adam and Eve exercised their soul: reasoning with the serpent in the mind, desiring the tree of knowledge in the emotion, and deciding to partake in the will.

## Significance

Despite being fallen without any hope, man was redeemed by God to even become one with God. Subjectively experiencing this should cause any one to marvel at His wisdom and His work.

Satan's words to Eve sowed a seed of doubt even before she partook of the fruit. 

Apparently man's fall was due to the serpent's outward temptation, but the intrinsic cause is the woman's assumption of the headship. She assumed it by speaking to the serpent without the covering of her husband. This response is most likely the first independent act recorded in the Bible. Eve should have simply stood on God's word and fled to God in her spirit.

"Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat ... but of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden you shall not eat of it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die."

Eve's recounting of the facts was fine, if not a bit inaccurate, but by responding she had already fell into the snare. This opened the way for the serpent to respond with a compelete falsehood: "you shall not surely die." First, the serpent questioned to sow seeds of doubt, and it ends with a direct contradiction to God's word. Surely the woman here was not using her spirit, she was engaging her mind.

Then, Satan posits that she would become like God, knowing good and evil. 

After this engagement, she partook of the fruit, and gave some to her husband. As a result, man's spirit was deadened.

## Result

On the surface or objective level, man's transgression against God's command led to an offense unto condemnation (Rom. 5:16). This alienated man from the life of God (Eph. 4:18) which prevented the fulfillment of God's economy. 

On a deeper and subjective level, man's fall also involved taking the fruit of the tree of knowledge into the body, implying an inward change. In this case, man's body was transmuted into flesh, Satan as sin in man's body (Rom. 7:18). This sin, the embodiment of Satan in man, operates from within, causing man's living to be one with Satan (Rom. 7:21). The fall also deadened man's spirit (Eph. 2:1). All three parts of man - body, soul and spirit - were corrupted in the fall of man.

The first group of objective facts have actually been annulled by what Christ has accomplished for man by His death and resurrection: reconciling man to God (Rom. 5:10) and regenerating man unto a living hope (1 Pet. 1:3). However, inwardly man still has the flesh, and must crucify the flesh by the cross of Christ (Gal. 5:24). It is paramount to realize that the fallen man's default state is to be utterly one with Satan in personality and nature; one should have no confidence in themselves, that is to be self-righteous.
