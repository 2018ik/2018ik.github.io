## Background

The **fall of man** is depicted throughout Genesis and exists in four stages. In the first fall, Satan as the serpent tempted Eve to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, who then shared the fruit with Adam. 

In the entire record of man's fall, the sole issue was that man failed to use their spirit to contact God. Rather than going to God, Adam and Eve exercised their soul: reasoning with the serpent in the mind, desiring the tree of knowledge in the emotion, and deciding to partake in the will.

## Significance

Despite being fallen without any hope, man was redeemed by God to even become one with God. Subjectively experiencing this should cause any one to marvel at His wisdom and His work.
