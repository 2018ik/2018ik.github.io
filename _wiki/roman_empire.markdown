## Background

Many great universal events took place under the Roman empire, such as the earthly ministry of Christ.

## Significance

Roman history was terrible, yet the Lord was born into that situation to carry out His economy. Evidently, He was not there to change society or to do any social work. We must live properly in society today to carry out God's economy in a real way. The Lord is arranging things for His second coming into a likewise terrible situation For this we must build up the Body of Christ.
