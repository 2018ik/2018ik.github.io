## Background

**Harmony** (Greek: *sumfoneo*) is a synonym for oneness, and illustrates it as many instruments being attuned to notes which fit well together. In a symphony there are many instruments, and all must tune to the correct temperament so that when they play, everything will be in harmony. Likewise, we all must be attuned to the same mind and to the same opinion (1 Cor 1). This brings forth the one accord.

The matter of the one accord is not a one-time thing, we all must constantly be re-tuned. We must allow the Lord to adjust and calibrate us.
