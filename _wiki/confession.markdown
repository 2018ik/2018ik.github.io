## Background

Confession issues from the light of God. Having received light from God which exposed our offenses, we confess what we have seen and the blood cleanses us.

## Tips and tricks
1. We do not need to beg or go through some kind of mental application
2. The blood is applied to us when we simply agree with God has exposed
3. Genuine cleansing occurs when we are in the fellowship of life and light
4. We do not out-grow the blood; we always need to apply the blood as we will always fail
