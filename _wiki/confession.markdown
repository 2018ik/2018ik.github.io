## Background

**Confession** in the Lord's presence purifies the conscience and results in an intimate fellowship with the Lord. All believers must personally go to the Lord to thoroughly confess the things which their conscience convicts.

Confession issues from the light of God. Having received light from God which exposed our offenses, we confess what we have seen and the blood cleanses us. This is guaranteed as God is faithful and righteous to cleanse us from all unrighteousness (1 John 1:9). Actually, He does not even remember the sins which are cleansed (Heb. 8:12).

## Etymology

The Greek word for confess (ὁμολογέω) means to "say the same thing." This is in line with the function of the conscience, as whatever the conscience convicts us of, we should say the same thing and agree.

## Tips
1. We do not need to beg or go through some kind of mental application
2. The blood is applied to us when we simply agree with God has exposed
3. Genuine cleansing occurs when we are in the fellowship of life and light
4. We do not out-grow the blood; we always need to apply the blood as we will always fail
5. We must keep going to the Lord, and sooner or later, He will shine - it might not be today, but it could be tomorrow
