## Background

**Speaking in tongues** is a miraculous gift of the spirit was practiced by the believers after the pouring out of the economical Spirit in Acts 2:4.

## Significance

## Caveat

Speaking in tongues is not the guaranteed issue of receiving the Spirit, nor is it a significant matter. The only other book besides Acts in which speaking in tongues is mentioned in 1 Corinthians, where Paul emphasizes the importance of speaking for understanding. That is, He would "rather speak five words with the mind to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue which no one can understand" (1 Cor. 14:19). The practice which is greater is prophesying (1 Cor. 14:5), which is to speak for the Lord and to minister Christ to people.

The true significance of receiving the Spirit is to be born of Spirit (John 3:6). Even a donkey could miraculously speak a human language, but she was definitely not born of the Spirit (Num. 22:28).
