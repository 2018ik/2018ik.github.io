## Background

Speaking in tongues was practiced by the believers after the pouring out of the economical Spirit in Acts 2:4. 

## Significance

## Caveat

The only other book besides Acts in which speaking in tongues is mentioned in 1 Corinthians, where Paul emphasizes the importance of speaking for understanding. That is, He would rather speak five woeds with the mind to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue which no one can understand (1 Cor. 14:19). The practice which is greater is prophesying (1 Cor. 14:5), which is to speak for the Lord and to minister Christ to people.
