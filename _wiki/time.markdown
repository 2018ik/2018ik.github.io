## Background

**Time** was created by God as a realm in which to carry out His economy in man. Spiritually speaking, our existence in time is to prepare us for eternity. Time can be likened to a school where one can receive training and education to be useful to God in eternity. God's only goal in time is to dispense Himself into us day by day. Therefore, we need to redeem the time by being open to this dispensing in every situation (Eph. 5:16).
