## Background

**Abiding** is intended, experiential contact with the Lord as  the true vine. This is a matter of being in constant fellowship. To be joined to the vine as a branch is objective, but to abide in the vine is conditional and depends on one's openness to God. Insulation like sin and the world can distract from and limit the fellowship one has with the Lord, which would be equivalent to not abiding in the vine. Likewise, to way to abide in the Lord is the same as the way to remain in constant fellowship based on the cycle of life in 1 John.

Not only do the believers abide in God, but God abides in the believers (John 15:5; 1 John 4:15). Our abiding in the Lord is the condition for the Lord to abide in us.

## Etymology

The Greek word for abide (*meno*) is to stay, remain or dwell in a given place. The connotation here is someone is visiting a friend's home and wants to stay there.

## Biblical Basis

John 15:2 says that there are branches in the vine which do not bear fruit, while John 15:5-6 show that abiding results in much fruit. Therefore, to simply be attached to the vine in an objective manner is different than abiding, which is subjective. To abide in the Lord requires an organic life-union with Him, as with a vine and its branches. 

In John's first epistle, his main burden is also that the believers would abide in the Lord (1 John 2:6, 27-28; 3:24; 4:13, 15)

## Application

The practical way in which one abides in the Lord is to walk according to the mingled Spirit. To abide is to dwell, therefore, the Triune God mingled with our Spirit should be the home in which we carry out all our affairs. Whether or not we are in a good or bad situation should not matter to us, because we are abiding in the Lord. The only that makes us happy should be the Lord's presence. 

Abiding is also to follow the Lord's "commandments". These are not the commandments inscribed in tablets of stone as te law, but the Lord's words. The Lord is presently speaking to all believers and one of his favorite words is "no." When we are about to think something, read something, say something, we can heed the Lord's speaking. When we obey in this way, the Lord rules over us in love and light and life. We can pray this prayer: "Lord Jesus as you walked on the earth under the authority of God, live again in me such a life. Reproduce yourself in me as a man under authority."

### Testimony #1

>Two coworkers wrote to me that they were at the airport and they were taking their luggage out of the trunk. A car behind them started moving and didn't see them and hit one of them and broke his hip. Now, while that surgery is taking place, he's abiding. There is just joy there. That was his testimony. Similarly there is another brother in Germany in the hospital right now, on one hand seriously ill, on the other hand he is abiding in the Lord while he's lying on the bed. So this is a real way of living, and these brothers are a testimony that we in any situation deep within we will abide until we're raptured. 

###  Testimony #2

A number of years ago after I was married to my wife, she left for Korea to spend some time with her family maybe for two weeks or so and I felt so lonely. I realized my true home is not this one bedroom apartment but my wife. My wife is my true abode! I missed her home-cooked meals, delightful smile and wonderful sense of humor. Left me give you an illustration, when you live in a place where you live with that person, you enjoy that person's presence very much. And that person's presence becomes and enjoyment to you. Perhaps there is a troublesome boy named Tom and he's from the far east and getting terrible grades and his parents are so worried that they sent him to a preparatory academy and perhaps he moves into a house with a brother named John who's a Harvard grad. John becomes his friend, tutor, motivator and tennis coach. And as a result, Tom gets into Harvard, then Harvard Law School, and becomes a lawyer. He was living a life of failure, but by living with Jon, he became a real success. We're all failures. But God transferred us out of Adam into Christ and we began to live in Him and abide in Him!

### Testimony #3 

>The Christian life is not a matter of trying to align our will with God's will, but to abide in the vine, that is to live by the mingled spirit, that is for our will and God's will to be mingled together as one such that it even becomes ambiguous whether or not something we do is according to our will our God's will, yet we are able to do it anyways by faith since we know we are abiding in Him and have fellowship with Him. When the Lord Jesus did His works on earth, was it the Father doing it, the Son doing it or the Spirit doing it? Actually it was the Three working together as One. Today, we have been grafted into the vine to become one with the Triune God. The Christian life is a matter of living by our mingled spirit which is one spirit with God!

### Testimony #4

>A brother was once giving a message and he said something to the effect, "If you're out on the gospel and you get rejected, rather than being disappointed, you're happy, because..." I wasn't paying very close attention to the context, so I immediately thought in my head, "well, we remain happy because a seed was planted." But actually, he said it's "because the Lord's word is abiding in us." I immediately thought of the outward reasons why someone would be happy, such as having a seed planted or being more edified to preach the gospel in the future. But actually, as lovers of the Lord, the only thing that makes us happy should be the Lord's abiding, that is the Lord's presence. Is the Lord's presence not enough reason for me to be happy? Why must I justify my circumstance with outward things? If two individuals love each other, they don't care about each others' cars or houses, they only care about their presence. Likewise, we shouldn't care about God's bestowing of outward gospel preaching power or fruits upon us, but simply his presence.
