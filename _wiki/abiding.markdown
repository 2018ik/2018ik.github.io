## Background

**Abiding** is intended, experiential contact with the Lord as illustrated in John 15 where the Father is the husbandman, the Son is the true vine, and the believers are branches who abide in the vine. The branches are in the vine and [part of the vine](../corporate_christ), and whatever the vine is, is in the branches. Not only do the believers abide in God, but God abides in the believers (John 15:5; 1 John 4:15). Therefore, a believer is a part of Christ as a member of the Body.

## Etymology

The Greek word for abide is to stay, remain or dwell in a given place.

## Biblical Basis

John 15:2 says that there are branches in the vine which do not bear fruit, while John 15:5-6 show that abiding results in much fruit. Therefore, to simply be attached to the vine in an objective manner is different than abiding, which is subjective. To abide in the Lord requires an organic life-union with Him, as with a vine and its branches. 

## Application

The practical way in which one abides in the Lord is to walk according to the mingled Spirit. To abide is to dwell, therefore, the Triune God mingled with our Spirit should be the home in which we carry out all our affairs. Abiding is also to follow the Lord's commandments; these are not the commandments inscribed in tablets of stone as te law, but the Lord's words. The Lord is presently speaking to all believers and one of his favorite words is "no." When we are about to think something, read something, say something, we can heed the Lord's speaking. When we obey in this way, the Lord rules over us in love and light and life. We can pray this prayer: "Lord Jesus as you walked on the earth under the authority of God, live again in me such a life. Reproduce yourself in me as a man under authority."

### Testimony #1

>Two coworkers wrote to me that they were at the airport and they were taking their luggage out of the trunk. A car behind them started moving and didn't see them and hit one of them and broke his hip. Now, while that surgery is taking place, he's abiding. There is just joy there. That was his testimony. Similarly there is another brother in Germany in the hospital right now, on one hand seriously ill, on the other hand he is abiding in the Lord while he's lying on the bed. So this is a real way of living, and these brothers are a testimony that we in any situation deep within we will abide until we're raptured. 

###  Testimony #2

A number of years ago after I was married to my wife, she left for korea to spend some time with her family maybe for two weeks or so and I felt so lonely. I realized my true home is not this one bedroom apartment but my wife. My wife is my true abode! I missed her homecooked meals, delightful smile and wonderful sense of humor. Left me give you an illustration, when you live in a place where you live with that person, you enjoy that person's presence very much. And that person's presence becomes and enjoyment to you. Perhaps there is a troublesome boy named Tom and he's from the far east and getting terrible grades and his parents are so worried that they sent him to a preparatory academy and perhaps he moves into a house with a brother named John who's a Harvard grad. John becomes his friend, tutor, motivator and tennis coach. And as a result, Tom gets into Harvard, then Harvard Law School, and becomes a lawyer. He was living a life of failure, but by living with Jon, he became a real success. We're all failures. But God transferred us out of Adam into Christ and we began to live in Him and abide in Him!
