## Background

**Abiding** is intended, experiential contact with the Lord as illustrated in John 15 where the Father is the husbandman, the Son is the true vine, and the believers are branches who abide in the vine. 

John 15:2 says that there are branches in the vine which do not bear fruit, while John 15:5-6 show that abiding results in much fruit. Therefore, to simply be attached to the vine in an objective manner is different than abiding, which is subjective. To abide in the Lord requires an organic life-union with Him, as with a vine and its branches. 

## Etymology

The Greek word for abide is to stay, remain or dwell in a given place.

### Testimony #1

>Two coworkers wrote to me that they were at the airport and they were taking their luggage out of the trunk. A car behind them started moving and didn't see them and hit one of them and broke his hip. Now, while that surgery is taking place, he's abiding. There is just joy there. That was his testimony. Similarly there is another brother in Germany in the hospital right now, on one hand seriously ill, on the other hand he is abiding in the Lord while he's lying on the bed. So this is a real way of living, and these brothers are a testimony that we in any situation deep within we will abide until we're raptured.
