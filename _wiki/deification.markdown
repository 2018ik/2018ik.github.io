## Background

**Deification** is God's intention to make man God in life and nature but not in the Godhead. Fallen mankind, who were offspring of the devil, were not only redeemed, justified, reconciled, but furthermore begotten as children of God, having the same life, that they may even become God.

## Biblical Basis

The New Testament makes it exceedingly clear that believers are begotten sons of God possessing the same life, not merely adopted sons. John 1 reveals that God became flesh, that those who receive Him would become children of God, begotten of God (John 1:12-13). Romans 8:29 says that the Son was the Firstborn among many brothers. 

God became man in incarnation, and in resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). So a man, Jesus, became a life-giving Spirit, which no doubt refers to the Holy Spirit, which is God, as only God gives life (John 5:21). Therefore, there is no doubt that man became God at one point in history, and this model serves as the prototype through which God gains His many brothers (Rom. 8:29).
