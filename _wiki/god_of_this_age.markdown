## Background

Satan as the **god of this age** has temporary authority over the world along with his spiritual forces of evil (2 Cor. 4:4; Eph. 6:12). He has has blinded the thoughts of the unbelievers that the gospel may not shine upon them (2 Cor. 4:4). Today, nearly all people have been blinded by the god of this age. The content in the school system, social media and the internet are all used by Satan to blind the unbelievers. Those who are blinded think they do not worship anything, but they are actually worshipping Satan.

## Significance

## Gospel

In order for the gospel to shine, we must pray to bind the god of this age. When going out on the gospel in groups, when one speak, the others must pray.
