## Background

The **seven seals** are things which are sealed which are opened throughout history for God's administration on earth.

## 1-4

The first four seals were opened from Christ's ascension and will stay open to the end of the age of grace. The seals released the four horses, which are gospel preaching, war, famine and death respectively. 

# 5

The fifth seal is the cry of the martyred saints who will cry to God for revenge. This takes place before the great tribulation.

# 6

The sixth seal takes place shortly before the great tribulation and results in a shaking of the earth and heaven (Rev. 6:12-17).

# 7

The seventh seal consists of the seven trumpets.
