## Background

The **Lord's supper** refers to the supper which Jesus ate with His disciples prior to His crucifixion where He established His table with the bread and the cup to replace the Feast of the Passover (Mark 14:12-26). The supper is a subset of the Lord's table, occurring during the Lord's table. There are two aspects to the table meeting. One one hand, the believers attend the *Lord's table* for their own enjoyment, but on the other hand, they are partaking of the *Lord's supper* for God's enjoyment.

Eating the supper is a reminder to the believers that that they are living on earth for the Lord's satisfaction (Mark 14:25-26). The Lord says in Luke 22:15 that "with desire I have desired to eat this passover with you." The Lord desires for us to eat His supper, and when we do so it satisfies Him.
