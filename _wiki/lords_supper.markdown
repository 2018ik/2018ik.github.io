## Background

The **Lord's supper** refers to the supper which Jesus ate with His disciples prior to His crucifixion where He established His table with the bread and the cup to replace the Feast of the Passover. There are two aspects to the table meeting. One one hand, the believers partake from the Lord's table for their own enjoyment, but on the other hand, they are partaking of the Lord's supper for His enjoyment.
