## Background

The **Lord's supper** refers to the supper which Jesus ate with His disciples prior to His crucifixion where He established His table with the bread and the cup to replace the Feast of the Passover (Mark 14:12-26). The supper is a subset of the Lord's table, occurring during the Lord's table. Strictly speaking, we attend the table, but we eat the supper. Eating the supper is for remembrance of the Lord, and is a reminder to the believers that that they are living on earth for the Lord's satisfaction (Mark 14:25-26). There are two aspects to the table meeting. One one hand, the believers attend the *Lord's table* for their own enjoyment, but on the other hand, they are partaking of the *Lord's supper* for God's enjoyment.
