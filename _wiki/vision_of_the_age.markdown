>"It is grossly wrong to sa that w are following a certain person. We are following a vision that belongs to the present age. It is God's consummate vision."

\- *The Vision of the Age*, p.49

## Background

In every age there is the **vision of that age**, and believers must serve God according to this vision, to accomplish the things He wants to get done in that age. This vision refers to the overall vision and direction in that particular time. As God's work progresses through time, each vision inherits from the prior vision, consummating in the all-inheriting vision of the New Jerusalem.

The Bible reveals that in every age He gives only one vision to man, and that God is not democratic in whom He chooses to receive divine revelation (Acts 26:19, Eph 1:17). In the Old Testament the vision flowed from Adam through Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Joshua, Samuel, David, and the prophets. In the gospels, there was John the Baptist, then Jesus. In the beginning of the book of Acts, Peter was the only one who spoke for God. By Acts 13, God raised up Paul who saw the Body of Christ. Lastly, in Revelation, John saw the vision of the New Jerusalem. 
 
As in Noah's ark, in God's building there is only "one window" - one revelation and one vision through one ministry (Gen 6:13-14, 16). This window is the life-giving Spirit, which enables God's people to see such a vision. The commission associated with a vision of the age is carried out through the ministry of that age. As long as we are Christians, we should enter into the Lord's ministry in this age. 

**In every age there is only one stream of God's work. If we want to enter into God's work for a particular age, we need to enter into that stream.**

### Visions in the Bible

#### Noah's Ark

Noah received a vision from God concerning what God wanted to at that particular time. He wanted a new beginning with mankind through Noah, so He gave him the vision of the ark. The commission here is to do the building work.  

#### Moses

Moses saw the burning bush, and showed Moses how to begin the exodus from Egypt, as well as further on how to build the tabernacle for God's habitation on the earth.

#### David

God wanted man to build Him a temple in the good land, so he gave David a vision of what God wanted to do. He also gave David a commission, but due to David's failure, the commission was given to Solomon, who built according to David's vision.

#### Solomon

Solomon built the temple.

#### John the Baptist

For a short period of time, John the Baptist was the forerunner of Jesus and held the vision of that age. However, after the Lord Jesus began His ministry, John's time was fulfilled and his ministry was finished.

#### Jesus

He has God's vision, and knew exactly what God wanted to do. Everyone at that time could only serve God under the vision which Jesus saw. Unsurprisingly, the Lord did everything in coordination with God the Father to carry out the commission from manger to cross to resurrection to ascension to descension.

#### Peter

#### Paul

Paul saw a vision, and he was not disobedient to it (Acts 26:19). He saw a physical vision on the road to Damascus, but the heavenly vision Paul is referring to here which directed his living is a seeing from the spirit.

#### John

John saw the vision of the New Jerusalem in his 90s, as he wrote in the Book of Revelation.

### Further Visions

#### Martin Luther

#### John-Nelson Darby

#### Watchman Nee

#### Witness Lee

## Vision of Today

The up-to-date vision which God has given to the Lord's recovery today is an all-inheriting and all-inclusive one that extends all the way from Adam's vision of the tree of life in the garden of Eden to the New Jerusalem with the tree of life. Many are serving or have served under a partial vision. For example the Jews serve under a certain incomplete vision of the Pentateuch; some may serve under the vision presented in the four New Testament gospels. When Paul saw the up-to-date vision of the age (God mingled with man for the building up of the Body of Christ), Barnabas, Peter and James were left behind. The church in Jerusalem did not come up fully to the vision of the age - James insisted that the church continue to keep the law of Moses (Acts 15). Likewise, Apollos was powerful in expounding the Old Testament but was not up-to-date with the existence of the Holy Spirit (Acts 18-19).

Throughout the ages there were many saints who loved the Lord and feared the Lord, but they did not have the vision that matched the age and did not live in one accord. Billy Graham was a very pure person and thousands received the Lord through Him. However, his vision was not complete, and the standard of his service was not high enough. We admire and appreciate him to the uttermost, but we have to admit that his service did not reach the level with regards to the all-inclusive vision which God reveals in the Bible.

We should not merely serve God based on a single vision in the Bible; our vision must include all scenes. However the goal of our service, must ultimately consummate in the scene and vision in the Bible: the New Jerusalem.
