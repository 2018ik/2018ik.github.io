## Background

In every age there is the vision of that age, and we need to serve God according to the vision of that age. God's word reveals to us that in every age He gives only one vision to man (Acts 26:19, Eph 1:17).

In the building of god, there is only "one window" - one revelation and one vision through one ministry. This window is the life-giving Spirit, which enables us to see such a vision. If we are shown such a vision, we should live according to it (Acts 26:19).

### Noah's Ark

Noah's Ark only has one window on the highest floor. 

### The New Jerusalem

John saw the vision of the New Jerusalem in his 90s, as he wrote in the Book of Revelation.

### An All-Inclusive Vision of Today

Our vision extends all the way from Adam's vision of the tree of life in the garden of Eden to the New Jerusalem with the tree of life. 

We should not merely serve God based on a single vision in the Bible; our vision must include all scenes. However the goal of our service, must ultimately consummate in the final vision of the Bible: the New Jerusalem.
