>"It is grossly wrong to sa that w are following a certain person. We are following a vision that belongs to the present age. It is God's consummate vision."

\- *The Vision of the Age*, p.49

## Background

In every age there is the **vision of that age**, and we need to serve God according to a certain commission, to accomplish the things He wants to get done in that age. The vision of an age refers to the overall vision and direction in that particular time. The way by which we carry out this commission is through the ministry of the age. 

God's word reveals to us that in every age He gives only one vision to man (Acts 26:19, Eph 1:17). In the building of god, there is only "one window" - one revelation and one vision through one ministry (Gen 6:13-14, 16). This window is the life-giving Spirit, which enables us to see such a vision. If we are shown such a vision, we should live according to it (Acts 26:19).

## One Vision

The Bible shows us clearly that in every age God only gives the  vision of the age to on man; we cannot find in the Bible that there were two visions for any one age. In the gospels, only Jesus had God's vision. In the beginning of the book of Acts, Peter was the only one who spoke for God. By Acts 13, another one is raised up by God: Paul. The vision he saw regarding the Body of Christ went further than the vision of Peter. Lastly, in Revelation, John saw the vision of the New Jerusalem. 

**In every age there is only one stream of God's work. If we want to enter into God's work for a particular age, we need to enter into that stream.**

### Visions in the Bible

#### Noah's Ark

Noah received a vision from God concerning what God wanted to at that particular time. He wanted a new beginning with mankind through Noah, so He gave him the vision of the ark. The commission here is to do the building work.  

#### Moses

Moses saw the burning bush, and showed Moses how to begin the exodus from Egypt, as well as further on how to build the tabernacle for God's habitation on the earth.

#### David

God wanted man to build Him a temple in the good land, so he gave David a vision of what God wanted to do. He also gave David a commission, but due to David's failure, the commission was given to Solomon, who built according to David's vision.

#### Jesus

He has God's vision, and knew exactly what God wanted to do. Everyone at that time could only serve God under the vision which Jesus saw. Unsurprisingly, the Lord did everything in coordination with God the Father to carry out the commission from manger to cross to resurrection to ascension to descension.

#### Peter

#### Paul

#### John

#### The New Jerusalem

John saw the vision of the New Jerusalem in his 90s, as he wrote in the Book of Revelation.

## An All-Inclusive Vision of Today

Our current vision of the age extends all the way from Adam's vision of the tree of life in the garden of Eden to the New Jerusalem with the tree of life. 

We should not merely serve God based on a single vision in the Bible; our vision must include all scenes. However the goal of our service, must ultimately consummate in the final vision of the Bible: the New Jerusalem.

## Up-to-date

To have the vision of the age means our vision is up to date. Many today are serving and in the past have served under a partial vision. For example the Jews serve under a certain incomplete vision of the Pentateuch; some may serve under the vision presented in the four New Testament gospels. When Paul saw the up-to-date vision of the age (God mingled with man for the building up of the Body of Christ), Barnabas, Peter and James were left behind. The church in Jerusalem did not come up fully to the vision of the age - James insisted that the church continue to keep the law of Moses (Acts 15). Likewise, Apollos was powerful in expounding the Old Testament but was not up-to-date with the existence of the Holy Spirit (Acts 18-19).

Billy Graham was a very pure person and thousands received the Lord through Him. However, his vision was not complete, and the standard of his service was not high enough. We admire and appreciate him to the uttermost, but we have to admit that his service did not reach the level with regards to the all-inclusive vision which God reveals in the Bible.

Our vision for this age extends all the way from Adam's vision of the tree of life to the New Jerusalem with the tree of life. We do not serve God accordingly to the first few scenes alone; we are serving God according to the last scene, the New Jerusalem, which includes all the previous ones.
