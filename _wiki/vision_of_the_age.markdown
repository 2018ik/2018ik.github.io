>"It is grossly wrong to sa that w are following a certain person. We are following a vision that belongs to the present age. It is God's consummate vision."

\- *The Vision of the Age*, p.49

## Background

In every age there is the vision of that age, and we need to serve God according to the commission of the vision of that age. The way by which we carry out this commission is through the ministry of the age. 

In every age the Lord has special things that he wants to accomplish. The vision of an age refers to the overall vision and direction of that particular age.
God's word reveals to us that in every age He gives only one vision to man (Acts 26:19, Eph 1:17). In the building of god, there is only "one window" - one revelation and one vision through one ministry (Gen 6:13-14, 16). This window is the life-giving Spirit, which enables us to see such a vision. If we are shown such a vision, we should live according to it (Acts 26:19).

## One Vision

The Bible shows us clearly that in every age God only gives the  vision of the age to on man; we cannot find in the Bible that there were two visions for any one age. In the gospels, only Jesus had God's vision. In the beginning of the book of Acts, Peter was the only one who spoke for God. By Acts 13, another one is raised up by God: Paul. The vision he saw regarding the Body of Christ went further than the vision of Peter. Lastly, in Revelation, John saw the vision of the New Jerusalem. 

**In every age there is only one stream of God's work. If we want to enter into God's work for a particular age, we need to enter into that stream.**

## Divine Commission

With the vision of the age, comes the divine commission of the vision of the age. The way by which we fulfill this commission is by the all-sufficient grace of God. 

## Up-to-date

To have the vision of the age means our vision is up to date. Many today are serving and in the past have served under a partial vision. For example the Jews serve under a certain incomplete vision of the Pentateuch; some may serve under the vision presented in the four New Testament gospels. When Paul saw the up-to-date vision of the age (God mingled with man for the building up of the Body of Christ), Barnabas, Peter and James were left behind. The church in Jerusalem did not come up fully to the vision of the age - James insisted that the church continue to keep the law of Moses (Acts 15). Likewise, Apollos was powerful in expounding the Old Testament but was not up-to-date with the existence of the Holy Spirit (Acts 18-19).

Billy Graham was a very pure person and thousands received the Lord through Him. However, his vision was not complete, and the standard of his service was not high enough. We admire and appreciate him to the uttermost, but we have to admit that his service did not reach the level with regards to the all-inclusive vision which God reveals in the Bible.

Our vision for this age extends all the way from Adam's vision of the tree of life to the New Jerusalem with the tree of life. We do not serve God accordingly to the first few scenes alone; we are serving God according to the last scene, the New Jerusalem, which includes all the previous ones.
