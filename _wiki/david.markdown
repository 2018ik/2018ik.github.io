## Background

**David** was the youngest son of Jesse, a shepherd from Bethlehem, chosen by God to be the king of Israel. Though initially overlooked by men, he was anointed by Samuel according to God’s sovereign selection (1 Sam. 16:1-13). His early life as a shepherd cultivated in him a heart after God, which was later expressed in his psalms and his reliance on the Lord. David gained national recognition after his victory over Goliath, demonstrating his faith in God’s name rather than human strength (1 Sam. 17:45-47). Despite his anointing, David underwent years of suffering and persecution under Saul before ascending to the throne, illustrating God’s principle of transforming His chosen vessels for His purpose.

## Significance

David is a crucial figure in God’s economy, prefiguring Christ as the anointed King and the shepherd of God’s people. Matthew 12:3 makes a direct comparison between David and the Lord Jesus, as one who was able to break a certain ordinance in order to fulfill God's need at a particular time. His reign established the kingdom of Israel in a way that typifies Christ’s coming millennial reign. Furthermore, David’s experiences from his anointing to his sufferings and ultimate kingship reflect the pathway of Christ and His believers. Like David, Christ passed through many trials from manger to the cross. Though David failed in certain aspects, including his sin with Bathsheba (2 Sam. 11), his genuine repentance and turning to God (Psa. 51) reveal a heart that aligned with God’s purpose.
