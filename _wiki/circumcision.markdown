## Background

**Circumcision** in the New Testament is the cutting off of the flesh through the cross (Col. 2:11). The Old Testament ordinance was a shadow of the cross, which is the reality of the ordinance. While the Judaizers boasted in their circumcision, and required such for salvation, Paul boasted in the cross of Christ (Gal. 6:14). 

## Significance

Circumcision is a type of all laws and ordinances which one imposes on themselves and carries out themselves for the sake of pleasing God. This could be as severe as asceticism to reading the Bible every evening in a legal way. In Galatians 6:15, Paul says that circumcision and uncircumcision both amount to nothing, and the new creation is what matters. This means that the practice itself doesn't matter. For example, baptism by immersion or by sprinkling, or having the Lord's day meeting in the morning or the evening. What matters is, whatever someone is practicing, are they practicing it in the new creation? Paul is very liberal in his dealing with other believers, especially new ones. He would gladly conform to their practices for the sake of not stumbling them. Because to him, the outward practice does not matter, what matters is the new creation.
