## Background

**Gifts** in the Bible mainly refer to outward functions given by grace to the believers for the building up of the Body of Christ. These could be miraculous, such as healing and speaking in tongues (1 Cor. 12:9-10), or organic functions which manifest through growth in the divine life, such as the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers in Ephesians 4:8. 

In fact, Romans 12:4-8 reveals that showing mercy, giving hospitality and presenting material offerings are gifts. Someone may not have the gift of preaching or administration, but they may be able to provide hospitality by cooking meals and making beds. Some can't do any of this but they can at least give in simplicity (Rom. 12:8), giving a few dollars for the Lord's work.

Ephesians 4 and Romans 12 are about the church and the Body, as such, the context shows that gifts are not given to individuals for their own sake but for the building up of the Body. Each member of the Body must function, and each member of the Body has a gift (Eph. 4:7). Ephesians 4:12 says that these gifts are for perfecting the saints unto te work of the ministry unto the building up of the Body of Christ. Furthermore, the gifts of apostleship, shepherding, etc. are not mutually exclusive, as Paul, an apostle (1 Cor. 9:1) clearly is gifted in and functions as all of the aforementioned roles.

It is worth noting that gifts also occasionally refer generally to inward gifts received by all believers by faith, such as eternal life (Rom. 6:23) and the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38).

Summary:

| Gift | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Gifted persons (Eph. 4:11) | Apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers themselves *are* gifts given to the Body. These persons are given a special portion by Christ to carry out these functions in a capacity that perfects others to do what they do. |
| Spiritual ability (Rom. 12:6) | God's grace comes with certain spiritual abilities that, as we grow in life, develop into functions through which we can serve God and build up the Body. In this sense, we are all gifted members. |
| Miraculous, outward gifts (1 Cor. 12:9-10) | Such as healing and speaking in tongues |
| Other inward gifts | Such as the gift of eternal life (Rom. 6:23), the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38), etc. |

## Significance

Gifts are useful, but over-emphasis on gifts is terrible. The pursuit of gifts does not help to build up the Body of Christ. In 1 Corinthians 1:7, Paul tells the Corinthians that they do not lack in any gift. Yet, in chapter 3 verse 1, he says that they were not spiritual men, but fleshly, as to infant in Christ. While the Corinthians preached gifts, Paul preached Christ crucified (1 Cor 1:23; 2:2).

Furthermore, gifts are given not for the individual. The situation in Christianity today is that gifted people use their gifts for their own ministry rather than to perfect the saints for the Body.
