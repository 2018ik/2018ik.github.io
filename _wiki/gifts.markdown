## Background

**Gifts** in the Bible mainly refer to outward functions given by grace to the believers for the building up of the Body of Christ. These could be miraculous, such as healing and speaking in tongues (1 Cor. 12:9-10), or organic functions which manifest through growth in the divine life, such as the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers in Ephesians 4:8. 

In fact, Romans 12:4-8 reveals that showing mercy, giving hospitality and presenting material offerings are gifts. Someone may not have the gift of preaching or administration, but they may be able to provide hospitality by cooking meals and making beds. Some can't do any of this but they can at least give in simplicity (Rom. 12:8), giving a few dollars for the Lord's work.

Ephesians 4 and Romans 12 are about the church and the Body, as such, the context shows that gifts are not given to individuals for their own sake but for the building up of the Body. Each member of the Body must function, and each member of the Body has a gift (Eph. 4:7). Actually, the gifts of apostleship, shepherding, etc. are not mutually exclusive, as Paul, an apostle (1 Cor. 9:1) clearly is gifted in and functions as all of the aforementioned roles.

Gift can also more generally apply to inward gifts received by all believers by faith, such as eternal life (Rom. 6:23) and the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38).

## Significance

Gifts are useful, but over-emphasis on gifts is terrible. The pursuit of gifts does not help to build up the Body of Christ. 

Furthermore, gifts are given not for the individual. The situation in Christianity today is that gifted people use their gifts for their own ministry rather than to perfect the saints for the Body.
