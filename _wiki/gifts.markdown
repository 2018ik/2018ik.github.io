## Background

The Bible reveals two types of gifts: 1 Corinthians 12 refers to different functions, whereas Ephesians 4:8 refer to various persons who are constituted with the divine life. Both of these chapters are about the Body, as such, the context shows that gifts are not given to individuals but to the Body for the building up of the Body. Each member of the Body must function, and each member of the Body has a gift.

Actually Romans 12:4-8 reveals that showing mercy, giving hospitality and presenting material offerings are gifts. Someone may not have the gift of preaching or administration, but they may be able to provide hospitality by cooking meals and making beds. Some can't do any of this but they can at least give in simplicity (Rom. 12:8), giving a few dollars for the Lord's work.

1 Corinthians 12 does mention some miraculous gifts, such as speaking in tongues, but these are listed last as they are the least profitable in building up the church.

## Significance

Gifts are useful, but over-emphasis on gifts is terrible. The pursuit of gifts does not help to build up the Body of Christ.
