## Background

**Elders** (or overseers) are mature believers which serve and oversee the church. The elders are appointed by the apostles in each church (Acts 14:23). They are also appointed in every city (Titus 1:5), which shows that the jurisdiction of the elders, as well as the church, is by city.

In Acts 20:28, Paul said to the elders that the Holy Spirit has placed them as overseers. In Philippians 1:1, Paul indicates the two offices in the local church as "overseers and deacons." Nowhere in the Bible does it indicate that the elders are rulers, or have any authority apart from God.

## Function

Elders as overseers should oversee the flock. This is not to be rulers or exercise authority over others. Neither is it to replace the functioning of the saints. In fact, the Lord Jesus is the only Lord and Master (Matt. 23:8).

### Taking the Lead

 In 1 Timothy 5:17 Paul says the elders who take the lead well are counted worthy of double honor. To lead is to set an example in doing things first that others may follow. This is not to enforce te rule, but to be a pattern, a role model, as Paul himself was.

 ### Teaching

 In 1 Timothy 3:2 Paul says that elders should be apt to teach. This is to teach and train the saints to get into the deep truths of the Bible. To do this, they must have known and experienced these truths themselves. 

 ### Shepherding

In Acts 20:28, Paul charges he elders of Ephesus to shepherd the church of God. However, in 1 Peter 5:2, the saints are told to shepherd the "flock of God." The flock does not belong to each individual elder, but to God Himself. Therefore, the church is not the church of the elder, but the church of God. 

The elders should not lord over the flock (1 Pet. 5:3) but to recognize that God has entrusted His flock to them that they may care for it. 

### Finances

The elders also take care of the finances. In Acts 11:29 and 30, the disciples sent funds to the elders. This is why in 1 Timothy 3:3, Paul says that elders should not be fond of money. Elders must be pure and transparent in money matters.
