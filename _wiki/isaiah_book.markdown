### Prophecies of Christ

Isaiah 53 prophesies concerning Christ, some of which have been fulfilled. As a root out of dry ground (Isa. 53:2), Jesus was in the dry world which was in darkness. 

The pleasure of Jehovah which prospered in His hand parallels the joy set before the Lord Jesus in Hebrews 12:2. In passing through every grief and trial, believers must pray for the joy set before the Lord Jesus during His crucifixion to be set before them.

Christ's intercession of the transgressors (Isa. 53:12) was fulfilled by His prayer to the Father to forgive His transgressors (Luke 23:34).
