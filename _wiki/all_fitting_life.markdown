## Background

The **all-fitting life** is a life that is able to fit into and accept any situation, treatment, environment, condition, and opportunity for the carrying out of one's ministry. This life is seen in Paul's experience where he gave no occasion of stumbling in anything that the ministry may not be faulted, commending himself a minister of God in much endurance, afflictions, necessities, etc. (2 Cor. 6:3-10). The secret to enduring these things is to have an enlarged heart, an intimate concern for man (2 Cor. 6:11-13).
