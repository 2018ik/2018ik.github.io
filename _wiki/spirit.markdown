## Background

The Spirit (also known as the Holy Spirit, Spirit of God, Spirit of Christ, Spirit of Jesus, Spirit of Jesus Christ, Spirit of Jehovah, Holy Spirit, Life-giving Spirit, Sevenfold-intensified Spirit) is part of the Divine Trinity, along with the Father and Son.

Every aspect of the  Spirit is for us to enjoy Christ. In fact, the Spirit of God dwells in man.

## Revelation of the Spirit

The revelation of the Spirit is progressive; beginning with the Spirit of God in Genesis which only had the divinity of god, and ending with the sevenfold-intensified Spirit in Revelation, which is an all-inclusive Spirit.

## History 

### Nicene Creed

The creeds in the early church were composed to describe what Christians believe because the believers were facing much persecution and needed to defend the faith. Thus, they composed creeds, short statements of faith, that were not intended to be prescriptive, but to describe what Christians to believe.

Though they became prescriptive, that is they define the Christian. However, they were rather brief, and did not fully cover the matters of the Divine Trinity and the son of God Jesus Christ, bringing about much contention.

The question of how God could be three yet one, and how each included the other became a major focus of the early church.

Because these creeds were written in the earlier church where the Trinity was the main matter of focus, not much was spoken regarding the Spirit. For example, the Nicene Creed only speaks regarding the Spirit superficially, stating merely that they believed in the Holy Spirit without anything else said of the Spirit. Later, the council of Constantinople further confirmed the deity of the Spirit.

### Further Development

The early church continued to affirm that the Spirit is distinct and has a particular function, but also that the Trinity is inseparable and mutually indwelled one another.

In general, the five agreed upon creeds regarding the Spirit's place in the Trinity were:

1. The deity of the Spirit
2. Oneness with Son and Father
3. Eternal distinction
4. Eternal inseparability
5. Working together as one

However, there was not much understanding of the Spirit; some believed that the Spirit was separate from the Son and represents the Son. This is tritheism - an emphasis of the three as separate gods. For example, some viewed the Spirit as the "Cinderella" of the story, which went out on its own, leaving the Father and Son behind. 

In the 1800s, it became generally accepted and widely considered that in resurrection the Son *became* the life-giving Spirit. It was also revealed the the Spirit makes Christ present to the believers, and that the Trinity operates as one.

### The Spirit of Christ

Finally, it was recovered in the 1950s that humanity is now in the Spirit, and that the Spirit contains a human element. 

Chapter 5 of *The Spirit of Christ* by Andrew Murray, a dutch reformer who lived in South Africa in the 1800s, reveals that the Spirit now as the Spirit of the glorified Jesus had the glorified humanity of Jesus added to it. So when the Spirit comes to humanity it contains the person of Christ in His humanity.

#### John 7

In verse 39, we see the "Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified." This is not that Christ as glorified, which became the requirement to *send* the Spirit, but the Spirit was *not yet*. The Spirit is eternal, and clearly operating in the Old Testament as a person of the Trinity. So in what sense was the Spirit "not yet" before Jesus was glorified?

When Jesus was incarnated, he lived a sinless life as the God man; he was anointed by the Spirit in baptism; he lived a human life, died, resurrected, and all of these things were processed into Him; all of these human experiences were constituted and compounded into Him. 

Christ's resurrection was his glorification, then the Spirit which had not been yet, came into being, to be the Spirit who now is. Christ's humanity was uplifted through resurrection and brought into the divine sonship, His humanity was glorified, His uplifted human virtues were now brought into the spirit, his experiences were then compounded into the Spirit.

The Spirit of God in the Old Testament was merely oil without the other elements compounded into it. Now through resurrection, through glorification, Christ's human living, death, and resurrection were all compounded into it. Christ is realized in our experiences as the Spirit, and because the Spirit contains these elements, Christ's glorified humanity can be lived out through us. This compound ointment containing Christ's divinity and humanity with uplifted human virtues is now in our spirit and needs to spread into our mind, emotion, will and body. This economical change in the Spirit is illustrated by such titles like "Spirit of Christ."

### Seven Spirits

The church continued to degrade, and could not fulfill God's eternal economy. The Spirit was intensified sevenfold to produce the overcomers from within the degraded church. The sevenfold intensified Spirit is the compound Spirit was each of the elements strengthened seven times.

## Essence vs Economy

When Christ became a man, He changed His form to become flesh (John 1:14). This is economical; essentially there is never change in the Divine Trinity. But by becoming a man, economically there was a change in form. When He resurrected from the dead he did not cast off His humanity it became a part of Him; His humanity had now interwoven into the Spirit. 

Economically, the Word became flesh, and then the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit.

## Titles

The Holy Spirit is referred to by many titles, each denoting a specific aspect of the Spirit.

### Holy Spirit

### Spirit of God

This is the Spirit of God from the beginning, mentioned in Genesis 1:2 brooding above the waters. This is also the Spirit of the creator, and was at that point located outside of man. This Spirit was "not yet" (John 7:39). However, this one is now in us as the Spirit of Christ.

### Spirit of Jehovah

### Lord Spirit

2 Corinthians 3:18 mentions the "Lord Spirit" or "Lord, the Spirit" or "Spirit, who is the Lord." This is a composite title like "Father God" or "Lord Christ" which simply means that the Spirit is Lord.

### Spirit of Christ

The Spirit of Christ mentioned in Romans 8:9 is related to the Lord's resurrection. This Christ is an all-inclusive Christ, and this Christ is God and the man Jesus Christ, the redeemer in whom we have redemption so this Christ is in whom we have all of God's purpose and full salvation. This title touches the all-inclusiveness of this Spirit and is used interchangeably with Spirit of God in Romans 8:9. As the Spirit of God dwells in us (Rom. 8:??), this implies that God went through a process so that we can contain Him. Therefore, this Spirit of God that indwells us is the all-inclusive Spirit of Christ that is living in us.

### Spirit of Jesus

The Spirit of Jesus is mentioned only in Acts 16:7  and is related to the Lord's humanity and human living.

### Spirit of Jesus Christ

The Spirit of Jesus Christ in Philippians 1:19 refers to Christ both in His humanity and human living and in His resurrection.

### Spirit of Reality

The Spirit of reality such as in John 14:17 shows that in the whole universe, only One is real. Being in the Spirit is required for anything we experience to be real. For example, the Spirit is the reality of resurrection, and the reality of Christ's all-inclusive death.

### Spirit of Life

The Spirit of Life in Romans 8:2 shows that Spirit contains the element of the divine life. If we have the Spirit, we have life.

### Life-giving Spirit

The life-giving Spirit seen in 1 Corinthians 15:45 is the same Spirit as the Spirit of life, however, *life-giving* indicates an active movement, while *of life* indicates an essential characteristic. For example, there is the bread of life (John 6:35) and the living bread (John 6:51). The bread of life indicates its condition is life, that is, we have a piece of bread which *can* give life. On the other hand, when we eat this bread and digest it, it becomes the *living* bread to us, as it sustains our living. Likewise, after taking in the Spirit of life into our being, it imparts life to us as the life-giving Spirit.

### Spirit of Power

The Spirit has power without economically. This spirit of power in Acts 1:8 allowed many to receive the Pentecostal power, which was had an outward power.

### Compound Spirit

This can be illustrated by the hin of olive oil and the four spices. When the ingredients were separated, the Spirit was not yet. After the spices are compounded into the oil, it is now the compound oil, able to anoint and signifies the compound Spirit.

### Seven Spirits

### The Spirit

### Transforming Spirit 

In 2 Corinthians there is a transforming Spirit (2 Cor. 3:18) which when attached has many functions: anointing (2 Cor. 1:21), pledging (2 Cor. 1:22), sealing (2 Cor. 1:23), inscribing (2 Cor. 3:3).
