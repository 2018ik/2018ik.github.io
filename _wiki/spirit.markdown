## Background

The **Spirit** of God or Holy Spirit, is part of the Divine Trinity, along with the Father and Son (Matt. 28:19). The Spirit is God Himself, as well as the essence and substance of God (John 4:24). Believers receive the Spirit when they are saved (Gal. 3:2) and every aspect of the  Spirit is for man to enjoy Christ. In fact, the Spirit of God dwells in man (Rom. 8:9), gives life to man (Rom. 8:11; 1 Cor. 15:45) and speaks to man (Heb. 3:7). The part of man in which the Spirit of God dwells is the human spirit (Rom. 8:16). 

The revelation of the Spirit in the Bible is progressive. The Old Testament opens with the Spirit of God in God's creation of the universe (Gen. 1:2), and the New Testament ends with the sevenfold-intensified Spirit in Revelation, which is an all-inclusive Spirit. Five critical points concerning the Spirit of God that are not sufficiently understood in today's theology are:

1. The Spirit that gives life that was "not yet" (John 7:39)
2. The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45)
3. The compound Spirit typified by the holy anointing oil in Exodus 30
4. The Spirit of life in Romans 8
5. The seven Spirits in Revelation

## Etymology

The words in the Bible for the Spirit of God and spirit of man are *ruach* and *pneuma* respectively in Hebrew and Greek. Besides Spirit (Ezek. 37:1; John 3:5-6), this word can also mean breath (Ezek. 37:5; Rev. 11:11) and wind (Ezek. 37:9; John 3:8).

## History 

### Nicene Creed

The Apostle's creed and the Nicene creed in the early third century affirms the existence and belief of the Holy Spirit, but does not elaborate on the purpose of the Spirit. Because these creeds were written in the earlier church where the Trinity was the main matter of focus, not much was spoken regarding the Spirit. Later, the council of Constantinople further confirmed the deity of the Spirit.

### Further Development

The early church continued to affirm that the Spirit is distinct and has a particular function, but was very unclear regarding the truth. Gregory Nazianzus, a early church father in the fourth century, said the some called the Spirit an Activity, some a Creature, some a form, others God. In general, the five agreed upon creeds regarding the Spirit's place in the Trinity were:

1. The deity of the Spirit
2. Oneness with Son and Father
3. Eternal distinction
4. Eternal inseparability
5. Working together as one

However, this is a very inorganic understanding of the Trinity; some believed that the Spirit was separate from the Son and represents the Son. This is tritheism - an emphasis of the three as separate gods. For example, some viewed the Spirit as the "Cinderella" of the story, which went out on its own, leaving the Father and Son behind. 

In the 1800s, it became generally acceptable and considered that in resurrection the Son *became* the life-giving Spirit. It was also revealed the the Spirit makes Christ present to the believers, and that the Trinity operates as one.

### The Spirit of Christ

Finally, it was recovered in the 1950s that humanity is now in the Spirit, and that the Spirit contains a human element.

Chapter 5 of *The Spirit of Christ* by Andrew Murray, a dutch reformer who lived in South Africa in the 1800s, reveals that the Spirit now as the Spirit of the glorified Jesus had the glorified humanity of Jesus added to it. So when the Spirit comes to humanity it contains the person of Christ in His humanity. The truth that Christ is the Spirit is arguably the greatest truth recovered in the nineteenth century.

In verse 39, we see the "Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified." This is not that Christ as glorified, which became the requirement to *send* the Spirit, but the Spirit was *not yet*. The Spirit is eternal, and clearly operating in the Old Testament as a person of the Trinity. So in what sense was the Spirit "not yet" before Jesus was glorified? It had not yet entered the believers to flow out as rivers of living water (John 7:38).

When Jesus was incarnated, he lived a sinless life as the God man; he was anointed by the Spirit in baptism; he lived a human life, died, resurrected, and all of these things were processed into Him; all of these human experiences were constituted and compounded into Him. 

Christ's resurrection was his glorification, then the Spirit which had not been yet, came into being, to be the Spirit who now is. Christ's humanity was uplifted through resurrection and brought into the divine sonship, His humanity was glorified, His uplifted human virtues were now brought into the spirit, his experiences were then compounded into the Spirit.

The Spirit of God in the Old Testament was merely oil without the other elements compounded into it. Now through resurrection, through glorification, Christ's human living, death, and resurrection were all compounded into it. Christ is realized in our experiences as the Spirit, and because the Spirit contains these elements, Christ's glorified humanity can be lived out through us. This compound ointment containing Christ's divinity and humanity with uplifted human virtues is now in our spirit and needs to spread into our mind, emotion, will and body. This economical change in the Spirit is illustrated by such titles like "Spirit of Christ."

### Seven Spirits

The church continued to degrade, and could not fulfill God's eternal economy. The Spirit was intensified sevenfold to produce the overcomers from within the degraded church. The sevenfold intensified Spirit is the compound Spirit was each of the elements strengthened seven times.

## Essence vs Economy

The Spirit has both essential and economical aspects. When the Lord breathed the Spirit into the disciples in John 20:22, this was the essential Spirit for their living. When the spirit was poured out in Acts 2:1-4 as a violent wind, this was the economical Spirit for God's economy and His move.

When Christ became a man, He changed His form to become flesh (John 1:14). This is economical; essentially there is never change in the Divine Trinity. But by becoming a man, economically there was a change in form. When He resurrected from the dead he did not cast off His humanity it became a part of Him; His humanity had now interwoven into the Spirit. 

Economically, the Word became flesh, and then the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit.

## Titles

The Holy Spirit is referred to by many titles, each denoting a specific aspect of the Spirit.

### Holy Spirit

The Holy Spirit in the Greek is written as "the Spirit the Holy" or "the Holy Spirit." This means that the very God who is the Spirit is "the Holy." In the Old Testament, God could make people holy outwardly, separated unto Him, but could not make them one with Him. In the New Testament, God can go further to make man one with Him. 

This is the Spirit which filled John the Baptist from his mother's womb (Luke 1:15) and of which Jesus was begotten (Matt. 1:20). 

### Spirit of Holiness

The Spirit of Holiness in the Old Testament is for making His people holy (Psa. 51:11; Isa. 63:10-11).

### Spirit of God

This is the Spirit of God from the beginning, mentioned in Genesis 1:2 brooding above the waters. This is also the Spirit of the creator, and was at that point located outside of man. This Spirit was "not yet" (John 7:39). However, this one is now in us as the Spirit of Christ.

### Spirit of Jehovah

The Spirit of Jehovah in the Old Testament is Gods reaching and caring for His people (Judg. 3:10; 6:34). The title *Jehovah* means "He who is who He is" i.e. the eternal "I Am." God appearing to Moses as "I Am who I Am" is to indicate that if Moses had a need for anything, God would supply. He is everything and takes care of man's every need.

### Spirit of Christ

The Spirit of Christ mentioned in Romans 8:9 is related to the Lord's resurrection. This Christ is an all-inclusive Christ, and this Christ is God and the man Jesus Christ, the redeemer. This title touches the all-inclusiveness of this Spirit and is used interchangeably with Spirit of God in Romans 8:9, as they are one Spirit. 

This Spirit of Christ is also mentioned in 1 Peter 1:10-11, which speaks of this Spirit testifying to the prophets. The prophets were able to search out the time and manner of Christ's human living because the Spirit of Christ made it known to them. This was possible as the Spirit is also the eternal Spirit (Heb 9:14). 

### Spirit of Jesus

The Spirit of Jesus is mentioned only in Acts 16:7 and is related to the Lord's humanity and human living. This record shows that there is some aspect of humanity now compounded into the Holy Spirit, and that this Spirit which includes the Lord's living from manger to the cross was needed for the apostle's preaching ministry, which had much suffering.

### Spirit of Jesus Christ

The Spirit of Jesus Christ in Philippians 1:19 refers to Christ both in His humanity and human living and in His divinity and resurrection. This is the all-inclusive compound life-giving Spirit. The Spirit of Jesus Christ bountifully supplies the believers to live Christ (Phil. 1:19). It is only by the operation of this Spirit that one can work out their full salvation (Phil. 2:12-16).

### Lord Spirit

2 Corinthians 3:18 mentions the "Lord Spirit" or "Lord, the Spirit" or "Spirit, who is the Lord." This is a composite title like "Father God" or "Lord Christ" which simply means that the Spirit is Lord, and that the very Lord in the heavens is in the human spirit as the pneumatic Christ. In order to behold the Lord as the Spirit, one needs an [unveiled face](../veil). 

### Comforter

John 14:16 names the Spirit as a Comforter/Helper/Advocate/Counselor/Paraclete to the believers. This is someone who takes care of our needs. Similar to the Lord Spirit, this title also implies the Lord is the Spirit when compared with Isaiah 9:6, which identifies the Son as "wonderful Counselor."

### Spirit of Reality

The Spirit of reality such as in John 14:17 shows that in the whole universe, only One is real, and reveals to man the things of God. Being in the Spirit is required for anything we experience to be real. For example, the Spirit is the reality of peace. In Ephesians 2:17, peace was announced as the gospel, but sometimes we are not at peace. The Spirit of reality guides us into real peace, which is God as peace. Furthermore, the Spirit is the reality of resurrection, and of Christ's all-inclusive death. To experience Christ as death and resurrection, as the wheat and barley, we need to Spirit of reality.

This Spirit can be seen working through the apostles to reveal to them truths necessary for the building up of the church. For example, the gospel of John was written around A.D. 90, after the consummation of the Spirit of reality. During the time of the gospels, the disciples did not understand many of the things that Jesus said to them. Now in retrospect, John adds commentary which states that though they did not understand what Jesus spoke at the time, they did now (John 2:20-22; 12:15-16).

### Spirit of Life

The Spirit of Life in Romans 8:2 shows that Spirit contains the element of the divine life. In Revelation 22:1 there is a river of water of life, which river is the Spirit. God in Christ as the Spirit flows into believers to be their life. This Spirit even gives life to the mortal body (Rom. 8:11). Many times the body is worn out and weakened, and it is difficult to attend the meetings. However, if the spirit is exercised to pray and contact the Lord, the divine life dispensed into the weakened body can revitalize it and provide strength to go to the meetings.

### Life-giving Spirit

The life-giving Spirit seen in 1 Corinthians 15:45 is the same Spirit as the Spirit of life, however, *life-giving* indicates an active movement, while *of life* indicates an essential characteristic. For example, there is the bread of life (John 6:35) and the living bread (John 6:51). The bread of life indicates its condition is life, that is, we have a piece of bread which *can* give life. On the other hand, when we eat this bread and digest it, it becomes the *living* bread to us, as it sustains our living. Likewise, after taking in the Spirit of life into our being, it imparts life to us as the life-giving Spirit.

### Spirit of Power

The Spirit has power without economically. This spirit of power in Acts 1:8 allowed many to receive the Pentecostal power, which was had an outward power. This is emphasized in Luke 24:49 where the outpouring of the economical Spirit is referred to as "put on power from on high." This is to put on like clothing, which is an outward expression of power and authority, items required for God's move on earth.

### Compound Spirit

This can be illustrated by the hin of olive oil and the four spices in Exodus 30. The olive oil typifies the Spirit of God in essence; the four spices typify the processes which Christ went through in incarnation, human living, crucifixion etc. When the ingredients were separated, the Spirit was not yet. After the spices are compounded into the oil through His resurrection, it is now a compound oil, capable of anointing and signifies the compound Spirit.

### Seven Spirits

### The Spirit

### Transforming Spirit 

In 2 Corinthians there is a transforming Spirit (2 Cor. 3:18) which when attached has many functions: anointing (2 Cor. 1:21), pledging (2 Cor. 1:22), sealing (2 Cor. 1:23), inscribing (2 Cor. 3:3).

### Spirit of Love 

In Colossians 1 there is a Spirit of love (Col. 1:8). This is the love-giving aspect of the Spirit. A person's natural love can only go so far; only the all-inclusive love of Spirit can enable someone to love all the saints, regardless of their personal preference (Col. 1:4).

### Eternal Spirit

Christ was offered through the eternal Spirit (Heb. 9:14), which is not bound by time. Therefore, His redemption applies to all people throughout history, including all in the Old Testament age. In fact, He was slain from the foundation of the world (Rev. 13:8). 

### Spirit of Grace

The Spirit is of grace (Heb. 10:29) which is God dispensed into man to be his enjoyment. As partakers of the Holy Spirit (Heb. 6:4), man receives grace through the Spirit of grace.

### Spirit of Glory

1 Peter 4:13-14 mentions the Spirit of glory and of God which rests upon suffering believers. This is the Spirit which operated on Stephen which caused his face to be like that of an angel (Acts 6:15).

### Spirit of His Son

The Spirit of is Son in Galatians 4:6 is not separate from the Son but another form of the Son who is sent into our hearts. The One who was crucified on the cross was Christ, but the One who enters into the believers is the Spirit. He came as the Son under the law to qualify all of us for sonship and to share in His sonship. To be redeemed is to be qualified for sonship, to receive the Spirit of the Son is for this sonship to be made real to us in our experience. When we see that we are actually sons of God we can cry out "Abba, Father!"
