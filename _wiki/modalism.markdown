## Background

**Modalism** is a teaching regarding the Trinity which believes the Father, Son and Spirit are temporary manifestations of one God. This could mean that at one point in time there was the Father, and then the Father became the Son, and then the Son became the Spirit. This is contrary to the Bible's revelation that the three of the Trinity are eternally coexisting.

Although the emphasis on the Old Testament appears to be the work of God the Father, and the emphasis in the four gospels is the work of God the Son, and the emphasis from Acts to Revelation is the work of God the Spirit, the entire Trinity was operating simultaneously during these time periods.
