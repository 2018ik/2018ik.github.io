## Background

The **rain and snow** in Isaiah 55:10-11 is a type of the word of God. Farmers love rain because it waters the fields, and they love snow even more because it waters while simultaneously killing all the bugs. The rain and snow waters the earth that it may bear fruit. Likewise, God's word waters man that they may bear fruit. This word does not go back to God vainly and will accomplish what He delights in.
