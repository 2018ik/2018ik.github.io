## Background

**Incorporation** is a synonym for coinherence which refers to the co-inhabitation of Christ and the believers as one unit (John 14:20; 1 Cor. 12:12). The divine incorporation between God and man can be called the Body-Christ, the incorporated God, and the corporate Christ. To receive and walk in Christ equals receiving and walking in the divine incorporation because Christ today is a corporate Body generated from Christ being wrought into all His members.

## Biblical Basis

1 Corinthians 12:12 says that the members of the body despite being many are one, and that so also is the Christ. "The Christ" here refers to a corporate Christ of both Christ as the Head and His Body. This is the corporate "Me" which spoke to the apostle Paul in Acts 9:3-5.
