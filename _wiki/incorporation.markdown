## Background

**Incorporation** is a synonym for coinherence which not only indicates a mutual indwelling, but also a mutual function. When the Son was born, is it not as if the Son was on earth while the Father was in heaven; neither is it that after the Son ascended, the Spirit was on earth and the Son is now in heaven. The Son on earth was a divine incorporation. Today, this divine incorporation is the cohabitation of Christ and the believers as one unit (John 14:20; 17:21; 1 Cor. 12:12). 

## Divine Incorporation

Divine incorporation refers firstly to the incorporation of the Three of the Trinity in themselves, 
God in His Divine Trinity is an incorporation through mutual coinherence and operation. John 14:10 says that the Son and the Father coinhere. However, verse 11 goes on to say that the Son's words are from the Father who abides in Him and does His works. The Father works in the Son, and the Son speaks, but the two workings here cannot be separate.

Then, through the resurrection of Christ, the regenerated believers were also brought into this divine incorporation. John 14:20 reveals that in that day, referring to the day of His resurrection, the Son will be in the Father, and the believers will be in the Son and the Son will be in the believers. This is the incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers. The verse prior says that the Spirit of reality will also abide in the believers. This demonstrates the full incorporation of Father, Son, Spirit and the believers.

This divine incorporation between God and man can be called the Body-Christ, the incorporated God, and the corporate Christ. To receive and walk in Christ equals receiving and walking in the divine incorporation because Christ today is a corporate Body generated from Christ being wrought into all His members. This incorporation is illustrated in three ways: the Father's house in John 14, the Son's vine in John 15, and the Spirit's child in John 16. We are united, mingled and incorporated with God. Uniting is a matter of life, mingling is a matter of nature, and incorporation is a matter of persons.

### Father's House

### Son's Vine

John 15 reveals that the Lord abides in the believers and the believers abide in the Lord. These are persons indwelling one another.

### Spirit's Child

### Body of Christ

1 Corinthians 12:12 says that the members of the body despite being many are one, and that so also is the Christ. "The Christ" here refers to a corporate Christ of both Christ as the Head and His Body. This is the corporate "Me" which spoke to the apostle Paul in Acts 9:3-5. 

2 Corinthians 2:17 says that those led by Christ speak in Christ. In chapter 13 verse 3, christ speaks in Paul. Not only do believers speak in Christ, but Christ speaks in the believers. This is the mutual functioning of God and man.
