## Background

**Incorporation** is a synonym for coinherence which not only indicates a mutual indwelling, but also a mutual function. When the Son was born, is it not as if the Son was on earth while the Father was in heaven; neither is it that after the Son ascended, the Spirit was on earth and the Son is now in heaven. The Son on earth was a divine incorporation where each manifest action of His was the working of the Trinity. Today, this divine incorporation is the cohabitation of Christ and the believers as one unit (John 14:20; 17:21; 1 Cor. 12:12). 

## Divine Incorporation

Divine incorporation refers firstly to the incorporation of the Three of the Trinity in themselves, which means they must coinhere and co-operate. The former can be proved with the same proof used for the Trinity being a divine and mystical realm: John 14:10 says that the Son and the Father are in each other. However, verse 11 goes on to say that the Son's words are from the Father who abides in Him and does His works. The Father works in the Son, and the Son speaks, but the two workings here cannot be separate. Although the working of the Father here is ambiguous (what is the Father actually working on?), it can be supposed that the work of the Father here is simply the incorporation of Himself and the Son. Thus, in verse 12, He who believes into the Son will also do these works, that is to be incorporated into the Trinity in the divine incorporation of God and man. 

It was through the resurrection of Christ that the regenerated believers were brought into the divine incorporation. John 14:20 reveals that in that day, referring to the day of His resurrection, the Son will be in the Father, and the believers will be in the Son and the Son will be in the believers. This is the incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers. The verse prior says that the Spirit of reality will also abide in the believers. This demonstrates the full incorporation of Father, Son, Spirit and the believers. John 17:21 further speaks of the believers being in the plurality of the Trinity ("that they also may be in Us") and 23 speaks of the Son being in the believers ("I in them"), demonstrating clearly the coinherence of God and man.

In terms of function, Philippians 2:12 tells te believers to "work out your own salvation with fear and trembling." However, the next verse says "for it is God who operates in you" (Phil. 2:13). Therefore, on one hand, it is the believers who work out their own salvation, and on the other hand, it is God who operates. While it was the Son on earth speaking, it was the Father who was doing His works. In the reality of the divine incorporation, when the believers are working, God is working, and when God is working, the believers are working.

This divine incorporation between God and man can be called the Body-Christ, the incorporated God, and the corporate Christ. To receive and walk in Christ equals receiving and walking in the divine incorporation because Christ today is a corporate Body generated from Christ being wrought into all His members. This incorporation is illustrated in three ways: the Father's house in John 14, the Son's vine in John 15, and the Spirit's child in John 16. We are united, mingled and incorporated with God. Uniting is a matter of life, mingling is a matter of nature, and incorporation is a matter of persons.

### Father's House

### Son's Vine

John 15 reveals that the Lord abides in the believers and the believers abide in the Lord. These are persons indwelling one another.

### Spirit's Child

### Body of Christ

1 Corinthians 12:12 says that the members of the body despite being many are one, and that so also is the Christ. "The Christ" here refers to a corporate Christ of both Christ as the Head and His Body. This is the corporate "Me" which spoke to the apostle Paul in Acts 9:3-5. 

2 Corinthians 2:17 says that those led by Christ speak in Christ. In chapter 13 verse 3, christ speaks in Paul. Not only do believers speak in Christ, but Christ speaks in the believers. This is the mutual functioning of God and man.
