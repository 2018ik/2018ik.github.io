## Background

**John the Baptist** prepared the way for Jesus Christ, baptizing in the wilderness for the repentance of forgiveness of sins (Mark 1:3-4).

## Significance

When John the Baptist came, He came in the way of righteousness (Matt. 21:32), and began the gospel of Jesus Christ (Mark 1:1-4). He also came with no culture and education, eating wild good and wearing wild clothing. This is in contrast with Moses who came to Israel with the law - many commandments, statutes and ordinances and the highest Egyptian education. 

The way of righteousness is to recognize that one is good for nothing except death and burial. John's baptism is for repetenance (Matt. 3:2), and to recognize the flesh is good for nothing, that they may then become righteous through the Christ who would give them a new life. In constrast, the law did not enable the Israelites to become righteous and justified no one (Rom. 3:20).

## History

John while he was in prison sent his disciples to verify whether or not Jesus was the Coming One or not (Matt. 11:3). It can be inferred that he wanted the Lord to help him escape, however His answer was "blessed is he who is not stumbled because of Me."
