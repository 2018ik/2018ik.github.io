## Background

## Significance

When John the Baptist came, He came in the way of righteousness (Matt. 21:32). He also came with no culture and education, eating wild good and wearing wild clothing. This is in contrast with Moses who came to Israel with the law - many commandments, statutes and ordinances and the highest Egyptian education. 

The way of righteousness is to recognize that one is good for nothing except death and burial.  The law did not enable the Israelites to become righteous. John's baptism is for repetenance (Matt. 3:2), and to recognize the flesh is good for nothing, that they may then become righteous through the Christ who would give them a new life.
