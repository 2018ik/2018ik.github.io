## Background

## Significance

## 6

Isaiah 6 presents a contrast to chapter 5, which described the world situation. Here, King Uzziah died - who was a good king. Despite this however, Isaiah says he saw the Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne (Isa. 6:1). This shows that no matter what the situation might be on earth and regardless of the degradation of God's people, Christ nonetheless remains the same in His glory.

Furthermore in verse 8, God is asking who will go for Him, to which Isaiah obliges to be sent. Today, there are many countries on earth that the Lord is moving in to which His people must be sent.

## 14

Satan fell from heaven because he became proud and wanted to uplift himself because of his pride. Likewise, Satan causes men to become proud in their thoughts so that they would usurp God's authority.
