## 6

Isaiah 6 presents a contrast to chapter 5, which described the world situation. Here, King Uzziah died - who was a good king. Despite this however, Isaiah says he saw the Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne (Isa. 6:1). This shows that no matter what the situation might be on earth and regardless of the degradation of God's people, Christ nonetheless remains the same in His glory.
