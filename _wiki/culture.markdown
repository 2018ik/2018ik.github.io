## Background

**Culture** is closely related to law and can be a veil that easily distracts from Christ, in which there is no culture, no race, no tradition, no preference and no religion (Col. 2:8; 3:11). Culture includes national characteristics and ways of thinking which people live by without any realization. Paul repeatedly warns in his epistles that culture, the tradition of men, distracts from Christ. In today's Christianity, culture divides; there are many churches raised up based on a particular race, but this practice is very clearly not what is revealed in the Bible. Furthermore, within the church, different cultures often come into conflict: what kind of food to eat, what kind of instruments to play, conversational mannerisms, etc.

Even "church culture" can distract from Christ. For example, singing hymns and praying before a meeting can be an outward form, rather than an issue of following the spirit. Only if one's spirit leads them to sing, call on the Lord or testify should they do so. On the other hand, people must be governed by the standards of culture before they receive Christ. Honoring parents, loving their family, being good students, behaving respectfully etc., are all elements of American culture, and serve as a child-conductor onto Christ (Gal. 3:24). This especially applies to children.

## History

Culture began in Genesis 4, after Cain murdered Abel and had to leave the Garden of Eden to go build a city. There, he had an occupation, entertainment, and all he had to survive. Culture came in to replace God and the tree of life.

## Abolishment

God has already crucified the law, race, tradition, culture, enmity and created one new man (Eph. 2:15). The only way the believers can be one is to live according to the one new man, which life flow is the one Spirit (Eph. 4:3).

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>Chinese people when they eat they slurp, especially soup and noodles. You may think it's disgusting, or uncivilized, but that is due to your culture. Likewise, the Chinese may use chopsticks. And they might think, people who use knives and forks are uncivilized. Those are weapons, not eating utensils. This is also culture. These cultural differences are because we have a problem with our heart, and are a ground for Satan to enter in.
