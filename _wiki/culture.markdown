## Background

**Culture** is closely related to law and can be a veil that easily distracts from Christ (Col. 2:8). These are national characteristics and ways of thinking which people live by without any realization. Paul repeatedly warns in his epistles that culture, the tradition of men, distracts from Christ.

On the other hand, people must be governed by the standards of culture before they receive Christ. Honoring parents, loving their family, being good students, behaving respectfully etc., are all elements of American culture, and serve as a child-conductor onto Christ (Gal. 3:24). This especially applies to children.

## History

Culture began in Genesis 4, after Cain murdered Abel and had to leave the Garden of Eden to go build a city. There, he had an occupation, entertainment, and all he had to survive. Culture came in to replace God and the tree of life.
