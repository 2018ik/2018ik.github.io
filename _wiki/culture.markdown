## Background

Human **culture** and ethics are closely related to law and can be a veil if used improperly. On the other hand, people must be governed by the standards of culture before they receive Christ. Honoring parents, loving their family, being good students, behaving respectfully etc., are all elements of American culture, and serve as a child-conductor onto Christ (Gal. 3:24). This especially applies to children.
