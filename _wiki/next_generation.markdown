## Background

Taking care of the next generation can be subdivided into three general age groups: the children, young people, and college students. Although this creates a distinction between these age groups, these are not disparate pipelines; there is only one Spirit, one work, and one flow. The connection between these three works generates automatic role models where each age group can see and learn from the next.

If we don't care about the next generation, and only serve the adults, we will nonetheless gain many through the "front door" but we will be leaking the young ones through the "back door." If a church cannot raise up its young people, then that church has no future.

## History

In 1967, the work was prevailing, but it was a general work mainly for the adults. The children were simply taken care of while the adults went to the meetings. However, it was then that a focus began to shift towards to young people to teach and to prepare them. No family will disregard its children; as a priority a family looks after its children, raises them, and teaches them. Optimally, of the newly gained ones, about half should be children of existing believers, and half should be from other sources.

## Importance

We need to see the preciousness of the young people and their importance in God's hands. Even Nebuchadnezzar saw the importance of young people, this is why he brought the young ones to his palace. 

TikTok actually serves the dual purpose of undermining the young people of the west while educating the young people in China. In like matter, the real enemy - Satan - does the exact same thing; dumb us down and occupy this generation to have no appetite for the things of God. Things that should be used to educate, train and perfect the young people to get into the Word of God are being turned to use to completely dumb down their ability to receive anything of God.

Many homes don't know how to deal with their children, so the church has to come in and help. The most important thing is still how the parents manage their own home. If parents just depend on the church to do it then there will be a lack. 

## How to Serve

### Minimum Requirement

The minimum capital required for the young people's work is to have a heart (2 Cor. 6:11). This does not mean our personal preference, but to see a genuine importance and value of the young people work. If we see this, then spontaneously we will have a heart for it.
