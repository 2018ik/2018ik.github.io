## Background

The **next generation** refers to the young ones in the church. Taking care of the next generation can be subdivided into three general age groups: the children, young people, and college students. Although this creates a distinction between these age groups, these are not disparate pipelines; there is only one Spirit, one work, and one flow (see: one piece work). The connection between these three works generates automatic role models where each age group can see and learn from the next.

If the church doesn't care about the next generation, and only serve the adults, it will have no future. It may nonetheless gain many through the "front door" but will be leaking the young ones through the "back door."

## History

In 1967, the work was prevailing, but it was a general work mainly for the adults. The children were simply taken care of while the adults went to the meetings. However, it was then that a focus began to shift towards to young people to teach and to prepare them. No family will disregard its children; as a priority a family looks after its children, raises them, and teaches them. Optimally, of the newly gained ones, about half should be children of existing believers, and half should be from other sources.

## Importance

We need to see the preciousness of the young people and their importance in God's hands. Even Nebuchadnezzar saw the importance of young people, this is why he brought the young ones to his palace. 

TikTok actually serves the dual purpose of undermining the young people of the west while educating the young people in China. In like matter, the real enemy - Satan - does the exact same thing; dumb us down and occupy this generation to have no appetite for the things of God. Things that should be used to educate, train and perfect the young people to get into the Word of God are being turned to use to completely dumb down their ability to receive anything of God.

Many homes don't know how to deal with their children, so the church has to come in and help. The most important thing is still how the parents manage their own home. If parents just depend on the church to do it then there will be a lack.

## How to Serve

### Vision

The key requirement as with anything in God's economy is to have a vision for one's service. The minimum capital required to work is to have a heart (2 Cor. 6:11). This does not mean personal preference, but to see a genuine importance and value of the young people work. If someone see this, then spontaneously they will have a heart for it.

### Experience

The previous generation can pass on their experiences to the next one. 

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>It's easy to not understand the experiences of the previous generation as the next generation. For example, when we say Holocaust, surely we don't have the feeling of enormity as those who actually went through it. Same for the children of Israel - all those born in the wilderness didn't experience coming out of Egypt, so they probably wanted to go back to Egypt to experience it. I say this because that's my experience. My parents had the experiences of coming out of Christendom, into the recovery and its stark contrast. Me, I didn't really appreciate the recovery as a young person. Sometimes I thought tht surely there must be some good. So the turning point was my freshman year, some sort of ecumenical, all the Christian clubs came together at some event and I went. There was a band and everything, and the song that sung was "God is good to me. God is good to me. Oh Oh Oh Oh. God is good to me." And then there was a sax solo. And that's pretty much the entire content. And  then we left early to go down the street to the small group meeting, where the first song called was 1198. A mighty flowing out is God. Okay, that's why they say the riches are here.
