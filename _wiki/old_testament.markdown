## Background

## Significance

### Instrinsic Significance

The Old Testament is a figurative portrait of God's economy; everything spoken of in the Old Testament are concerning Christ and must be fulfilled and has been fulfilled in Christ Jesus (Luke 24:44).

## Types

There are many Old Testament types which reveal Christ, most obviously the Passover lamb. However, there are hundreds of types which show some aspect of Christ. 

## History

The history of the Israelites show God's move on the earth today, and actually serve as an admonition to today's believers (1 Cor. 10:11). Each failure and success serve as a pattern for the New Testament believers. One one hand, there is a line of the people, which are the Israelites to bring forth Christ. On the other hand, there is a line of the land, which issues in the kingdom of God. There is a distinction between these two, as when the children of Israel degraded during the reign of the kings, they were eventually kicked out of the land and led into Babylon's captivity.

## Poetry

The books of poetry show that Christ Himself should be man's pursuit of perfection. We see pattern in praising, singing and contacting God.

## Prophecy

The books of prophecy show how the aforementioned books are going to be fulfilled.
