## Background

**Righteousness** is to be right before God according to His standard. The Old Testament way to attain righteousness was to follow the Mosaic Law. However, no one is justified by the law (Gal. 3:11), and the only way to be righteous is by faith (Gal. 3:24), walking according to the spirit (Rom. 8:4) that God may come in as grace to do everything for man (1 Cor. 15:10; Gal. 2:21).

## Aspects

In judicial redemption, Christ is our objective righteousness to justify us before God at the time of repentance and believing into Christ (Rom. 3:24-26).
