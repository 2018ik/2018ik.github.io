## Background

The **keys of death and of hades** are held by Christ who became dead and now lives forever and ever (Rev. 1:17-18). Because of the fall of man, death came in and is now working to bring everyone into Hades. However, the keys of death and of Hades are now in the hands of Christ through His death and resurrection. The Lord died and went to Hades, and then passed through death, overcame death, and came out of death; this is resurrection. 

Now as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), Christ is the reality of resurrection, and is able to enter into and impart resurrection life to His believers.
