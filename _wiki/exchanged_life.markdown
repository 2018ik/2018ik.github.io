## Background

An **exchanged life** refers to the concept that a Christian's human life is exchanged with the divine life of Christ, such that it is no longer they who live, but it is Christ who lives. This is based on Galatians 2:20, which states "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me." Religion has always separated God and man; the former who is omniscient, high up in the heavens, and the latter who is lowly and pitiful. However God does want to be separate with man, but to mingle with man and to become one with man.

Thus, the full story of Galatians 2:20 is as follows: even though it is no longer "I" who live, it goes on to say "the life which I now live I live in faith." So there is still an "I" who lives. Paul continues to live in faith, in an organic union with Christ.

## Proof

There are three pictures of the organic union between God and man, where man is not evidently not entirely terminated. First in John 15, there is the picture of the vine and the branches. The branches (the believers) are part of the vine, but they are distinct in their function. Then in Romans 7, there is the picture of the two husbands. Firstly, the wife and husband were joined together as one person, then the wife is joined to the new husband. In both cases, the wife is the common denominator. In Romans 11, there is a picture of the grafted life, which is similar to the vine in John 15.
