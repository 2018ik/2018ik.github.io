## Background

Calling on the Lord means to call out, to cry out or to invoke a person. Men began to call upon the name of Jehovah in the time of Enosh (Gen 4:26). 

Even from the lowest pit, we can call upon the name of the Lord (Lam. 3:55-56). In the same utterance from Jeremiah, we see that calling is closely related to breathing in the Lord. We can also cry out with a ringing shout (Isa. 12:3-6).

## History

See footnote 1 of Acts 2:21 in the Recovery Version

## Practice by Old Testament saints:

### Enosh

Calling began with Enosh, when men realized the vanity of human life, the fragility of mn, and the need to live for and according to God (Gen 4:26)

### Abraham and Isaac

Abraham and Isaac both built an altar to Jehovah and called on the name of Jehovah (Gen 12:8; 26:25). To from Ai (heap of ruins) to Bethel (House of God) required building an altar to call upon the name of Jehovah.

### People of Israel

Moses and the children of Israel all enjoyed the Lord by calling upon His name; calling brings the Lord near to all people (Deut. 4:7). They also enjoyed the Lord's forgiveness and mercy by calling on the Lord (Psa. 86:5).

### David

David called on the Lord during distress and trouble, which brings him to a place that is broad and free (Psa. 118:5).

### Zephaniah

> "I then will change the language of the people into a pure language, that they will call upon the name of Jehovah to serve Him in one accord"

\- Zephaniah 3:9

The secret to serving the Lord in one accord is to call.

## Practice by New Testament saints:

### Peter

Acts 2:21

### Stephen

Acts 7:59; 9:14, 21

### Paul

Acts 9:5, 22:16

Believing in the Lord and confessing with the mouth by calling upon the name of the Lord will save us (Roa. 10:9-10, 13).

The Lord is rich to all who all on Him (10:12) which allows Him to fill us, as empty vessels, with the rich Lord (Rom 9:23).

No one can say "Jesus is Lord" except in the Holy Spirit (Rom. 12:3). We drink the Spirit (Rom 12:13) by calling on His name. 

Calling on the name of the Lord also allows us to depart from unrighteousness (2 Tim. 2:19). Furthermore, seeking to be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, useful to the master, we need to call on the Lord out of a pure heart with companions (2 Tim. 21-22).

## The Recovery

Calling on the name of the Lord is one of the items recovered in the Lord's recovery. Thousands of saints have been released and enriched through calling on the name of the Lord.
