## Background

**Calling on the Lord** means to call towards the Lord to invoke His person. This is a [practical way](../speciality_generality_practicality#practicality) to exercise the spirit to receive life. Men began to call upon the name of Jehovah in the time of Enosh (Gen 4:26), and this practice spread to many in the Old Testament, eventually spilling over to the New Testament. Yet, today there are few who call on the name of the Lord. This is one of the items recovered in the Lord's recovery. Thousands of saints have been released and enriched through calling on the name of the Lord.

Even from the lowest pit, we can call upon the name of the Lord (Lam. 3:55-56). In the same utterance from Jeremiah, we see that calling is closely related to breathing in the Lord, since crying out breathing in for air. We can also cry out with a ringing shout (Isa. 12:3-6). When we simply turn out being to God and call on His name, we are saved (Rom. 10:13), not only judicially, but also from Satan, sin, the world, death, depression, anxiety, hopelessness, etc. 

## Significance

Calling on the Lord is not to get something from the Lord, but it is get His person.

## History

See footnote 1 of Acts 2:21 in the Recovery Version

## Practice by Old Testament saints:

### Enosh

Calling began with Enosh, whose name means "frail mortal man" (Gen 4:26). This indicates that man began calling when they realized the vanity of human life, the fragility of man, and the need to live for and according to God.

### Abraham and Isaac

Abraham and Isaac both built an altar to Jehovah and called on the name of Jehovah (Gen 12:8; 26:25). To go from Ai (heap of ruins) to Bethel (House of God) required building an altar to call upon the name of Jehovah.

### People of Israel

Moses and the children of Israel all enjoyed the Lord by calling upon His name; calling brings the Lord near to all people (Deut. 4:7). They also enjoyed the Lord's forgiveness and mercy by calling on the Lord (Psa. 86:5; Psa. 116:4).

### David

David called on the Lord during distress and trouble, which brings him to a place that is broad and free (2 Sam. 22:4; Psa. 118:5).

### Isaiah

Isaiah enjoyed the Lord's salvation by giving thanks to Jehovah and calling upon His name, reminding people that His name is exalted (Psa. 12:3-4; Isa. 55:6). Furthermore, He also sang psalms, cried out and shouted toward Jehovah (Isa. 12:2-6).

### Zephaniah

> "I then will change the language of the peoples into a pure language, that they will call upon the name of Jehovah to serve Him in one accord"

\- Zephaniah 3:9

The secret to serving the Lord in one accord is to call on the Lord's name.

## Practice by New Testament saints:

### Peter

Peter teaches during a gospel message that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved (Acts 2:21).

### Stephen

Stephen while being stoned called upon the Lord and said "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!" (Acts 7:59) and "Lord, do not hold this sin against them (Acts 7:60).

### Paul

Saul had authority from the chief priests to bind all who call upon the Lord's name (Acts 9:14). The way he determined who was Christian and worthy of persecution was based on whether they called upon the Lord's name (Acts 9:21).

In his epistles, he continued to profess the significance of calling on the name of the Lord. Firstly in the matter of salvation, believing in the Lord and confessing with the mouth by calling upon the name of the Lord will save us (Rom. 10:9-10, 13). The Lord is also rich to all who all on Him (10:12) which allows Him to fill us, as empty vessels, with the rich Lord (Rom 9:23).

In Paul's epistle to the Corinthians we see that the called saints are those who call on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in every place (1 Cor. 1:2). No one can say "Jesus is Lord" except in the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:3). We drink the Spirit by calling on His name (1 Cor. 12:13).

Calling on the name of the Lord also allows us to depart from unrighteousness (2 Tim. 2:19). Furthermore, seeking to be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, useful to the master, we need to call on the Lord out of a pure heart with companions (2 Tim. 21-22).
