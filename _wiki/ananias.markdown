## Background

Ananias was a disciple in Damascus whom the Lord spoke to in a vision regarding Saul.
Ananias must have had a very intimate relationship with the Lord, because the Lord could speak to Him.

Ananias was real with Lord regarding how evil Saul of Tarsus was (Acts 9:13). He knew that Saul had identified believers based on their calling upon the name of the Lord. This is a question we should ask ourselves - are we arrestable? Would Saul of Tarsus arrest us? We should be those who call upon the name of the Lord.

Ananias laid hands on Saul, the first thing he said was "Brother Saul." Saul could not have received his sight unless a member of body laid his hands on him. We need to depend on the body for our sight and ministry.
