## Background

The **new creation** is in contrast to the old creation, and is God's life wrought into the old creation, terminating what is old and bringing in what is new. The old creation was old because it did not have God; the new creation is new  because God is in it. According to Paul, the new creation is what matters (Gal. 6:15).

## Significance

God only cares about the new creation, and only the new creation can fulfills God's plan. Now what God has been added to man, man must live by this divine life mingled with his human life. We are often on the right or wrong, the tree of knowledge of good and evil, but this will never please God (Rom. 8:8).

## Spirit

The Spirit is what brings forth the new creation and is the only way the new creation can be experienced by man. As the old creation is experienced and actualized by the flesh, so is the old creation experienced by the Spirit. The context of Galatians chapter 6 where the new creation is mentioned is to sow unto the Spirit (Gal. 6:8). When someone sows unto the Spirit, the Spirit produces more and more of the new creation in them.
