## Background

The **new creation** is in contrast to the old creation, and is God's life wrought into the old creation, terminating what is old and bringing in what is new. The old creation was old because it did not have God; the new creation is new  because God is in it. According to Paul, the new creation is what matters (Gal. 6:15).
