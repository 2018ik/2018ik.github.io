## Background

Christ was set forth as a **propitiation place** (Rom. 3:25). 

## Biblical Basis

In Leviticus, the high priest sprinkled the blood of the sin offering on the ark seven times, and God would speak from between the cherubim. Psalm 80 says that "you are are between the cherubim shine forth." The cover of the ark that is the lid of the ark, is where Jehovah God is enthroned, and can be rightly called the mercy seat or throne of grace. God's righteous requirements were satisfied by the blood of the sin offering, thereby allowing God to communicate with His priests. The golden lid of the ark signifies God's holy nature which covers the ten commandments, which signify God's righteousness. Golden lid becoming red in color signifies that the requirements are covered (?). The high priest enjoyed the dispensing of the Triune God into him. It is called the throne of grace according to Hebrews 4:16. The cherubim is a cherubim of glory and according to Psalm 80:1, those who are between the cherubim shines forth. Lastly, God speaks to the high priest, imparting His words as spirit and life. 

This picture is fulfilled in Hebrews 9:12. Only when the Lord entered into the Holy of Holies through His blood was the redemption eternal. As the lamb of God, Jesus died on the cross to take away the sin of the world, and then He ascended to the heavens and sprinkled the precious blood in the heavenly tabernacle which obtained the eternal redemption. Now the throne of God which was of authority and judgement is now the throne of grace.
