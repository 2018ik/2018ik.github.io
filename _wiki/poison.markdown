## Background

**Poison** refers to crafty deceptions from the enemy which corrupts one's simplicity and purity toward Christ (2 Cor. 11:3). These are "fierce wolves" who speak perverted things to draw away the disciples after them (Acts 20:30). This also spoken of in Ephesians 4:14 as teachings from those who seek to lie and frustrate's God's purpose, leading listeners into a system of error (Eph. 4:14).

Those who seek to poison others are false apostles, and deceitful workers who disguise themselves outwardly as ministers of righteousness. This is unsurprising to Paul, as even Satan himself transfigures himself into an angel of light (2 Cor. 11:13-15). Technically speaking, as real apostles are ministers of God, these false teachers are ministers of Satan. Therefore, these teachings are not going to directly tell anyone to worship Satan or to worship idols. These are teachings which distract the believers from the pure enjoyment of Christ. Satan seeks to separate man from the [tree of the life](../fall_of_man).

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>There was a sister who was approached by someone claiming to know various behind-the-scenes truths of the Lord's Recovery. And even though she knew it was all fake news, it still affected her - since it is poisonous. Actually, if you are approached by someone like this, you should not entertain their speaking at all. Just say to them "I will not be your trash can." Don't be so nice.

### Testimony #2

>Not long after I was saved in the 60s, you know how old I am, at least roughly. At that time you have the understand we did not have life studies, we had some publications of Watchman Nee and in those days to have these accessible is not easy. A lot of people still read Scofield commentaries and so forth. So some leading brothers took some younger brothers and we read the Song of Songs, which is really good, according to Watchman Nee. So the Song of Songs become an attraction to me. Long story short, I went to the  bookstore and saw a commentary on Song of Songs. After I bought the book and read it, it just damaged all my enjoyment of the Song of Songs, because their interpretation is 100% wrong. And that gave me a lesson, do not read everything you see at the bookstore, or else your appetite may be poisoned. It took quite a few years to wash this away, it took time. So don't waste your time, be constituted with the pure word.
