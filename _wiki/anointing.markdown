## Background

The anointing refers to God as the Holy Spirit applying the very element of God Himself to the believers, which produces a particular sense through the spirit's function of intuition. In the Bible, the anointing always follows the blood (Lev. 14:14-18).  

## Biblical Basis

To anoint someone is to put ointment on someone, which is full of elements. The Spiritâ€™s anointing adds the elements of the holy anointing oil seen in  Exodus 30, which signifies the all-inclusive Christ. Furthermore, as the new element is added, the old element is discharged or killed, the compound ointment includes myrrh and cinnamon, which signify the death of Christ.

## Leading

The anointing is the Spirit, and the Spirit leads us. This trumps any prior human preparation.
