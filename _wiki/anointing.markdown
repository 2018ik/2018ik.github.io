## Background

The **anointing** refers to God as the indwelling compound Spirit typified by the holy anointing oil moving and working in the believers to apply the very element of God Himself, beginning from the spirit. This is an inward sensation similar to when a soothing skin ointment is applied, except this ointment is the all-inclusive Spirit that teaches concerning all things (1 John 2:27). The issue of the anointing is the teaching of the anointing which is based on the spirit's function of intuition, a knowing that is beyond human understanding. In the Bible, the anointing always follows the blood (Lev. 14:14-18). Therefore, to receive the anointing, one must be regenerated and have a clean conscience. 

## Biblical Basis

In Exodus, the holy anointing oil was used to anoint the Tent of Meeting and the Ark of the Testimony, as well as the priests (Exo. 30:25-30). Furthermore, all the kings and priests in the Old Testament were anointed. All of these anointed ones were related to God's dwelling place, His priesthood, His kingship and His commission. The reality of this Old Testament anointing is to receive the Spirit, which is typified by the anointing oil. The receiving of the Spirit can be seen in four stages: the Lord Jesus at His baptism in the Jordan, the Lord Jesus in resurrection, the Jewish believers on the day of Pentecost(Acts 1:5; 2:4), and the gentile believers in the house of Cornelius (10:44-47; 11:15-17).

1 John 2:20 tells the readers that they have an anointing from the Holy One, and verse 27 elaborates that this anointing teaching concerning all things. This is not a physical anointing, but the anointing of the Holy Spirit (Acts 10:38).

The Spiritâ€™s anointing adds the elements of the aforementioned holy anointing oil, which signifies the all-inclusive Christ. Furthermore, as the new element is added, the old element is discharged or killed, as signified by the myrrh and cinnamon, which signify the death of Christ.

## Function

The anointing, originating from the fellowship of the spirit, is a sense of life which supplies and waters the spirit to feel refreshed, brightened and strengthened. However, this feeling of life remains vague unless it is understood by the mind, which is what the "teaching" the anointing refers to in 1 John 2:27.

The anointing then passes through the conscience and intuition to become the the feeling of the conscience and teaching of the anointing respectively. The feeling of the conscience is to differentiate between good and evil, while the teaching of the anointing is related to the will of God Himself. Caring only about the conscience can lead to a faultless Christian, but God wants to become one with man, that man can understand the mind of God. Likewise, the conscience convicts negative things, while the teaching of the anointing is to lead toward a positive move.

The teaching of the anointing can give someone a revelation, a vision, and or simply a feeling regarding a certain decision such as marriage. This requires the interpretation of the intuition of the spirit by the mind in the soul, however it is not purely natural human ideation. This teaching is not necessarily a definite verbal confirmation or denial heard with English words, but an inward feeling.
