## Background

The **anointing** (or **unction**) refers to God as the indwelling compound Spirit typified by the holy anointing oil moving and working in the believers to apply the very element of God to their inward being, beginning from the [spirit](../spirit_man). Originating from the fellowship of the spirit, the anointing is a sense of life which supplies and waters the spirit to feel refreshed, brightened and strengthened. Furthermore, more of the essence and element of God is added to us. This summarizes primary purpose of the anointing: to add more of the essence and element of God into one's being. The secondary purpose is the teaching of the anointing which is based on the spirit's function of intuition, a knowing that is beyond human understanding. 

The primary purpose of the anointing is like painting, where layers and layers of paint are added to a surface and soaks into it, constituting the surface with the paint. The sense of life given by the anointing remains vague unless it is understood by the mind, which is what the "teaching" the anointing refers to in 1 John 2:27. Based on the context, this teaching is not doctrinal but concerning the indwelling of the Triune God (1 John 5:20). To receive the anointing and obey the teaching of the anointing is equivalent to walking by the spirit, abiding in Christ, living in fellowship with God, etc. The entire Christian life and walk is one that is guided by the anointing. John uniquely summarizes the Christian life as one under the inner anointing.

## Etymology

The Greek word for anointing (χρίσμα) is a gerund of the word to paint or to apply. The word does not refer to a substance such as an ointment, but a liquid substance in motion, such as an ointment being worked into a surface. This indicates that the Holy Spirit is not still, but constantly moving. Thus our present experience of the anointing can be likened to an inward sensation similar to when a soothing skin ointment is applied. It is one thing to be *anointed* but John specifically speaks of an active *anointing*. 

## Biblical Basis

Although the word anointing only appears in 1 John 2:20 and 27, the thought of anointing runs through the entire Bible. It starts in Genesis 28:18 - Jacob sets up the pillar that is his pillow and anoints it. And he says "This is the house of God." This is all of God's economy in type in one verse; the Spirit poured out on us that we would be built up as the house of God.

In Exodus, the holy anointing oil was used to anoint the Tent of Meeting and the Ark of the Testimony, as well as the priests (Exo. 30:25-30). Furthermore, all the kings and priests in the Old Testament were anointed. All of these anointed ones were related to God's dwelling place, His priesthood, His kingship and His commission. The reality of this Old Testament anointing is to receive the Spirit, which is typified by the anointing oil. The receiving of the Spirit can be seen in four stages: the Lord Jesus at His baptism in the Jordan, the Lord Jesus in resurrection, the Jewish believers on the day of Pentecost  (Acts 1:5; 2:4), and the gentile believers in the house of Cornelius (10:44-47; 11:15-17).

In the OT, the anointing always follows the blood (Lev. 14:14-18), and in the NT, 1 John reveals that after being cleansed with the blood, fellowship with God is restored which brings in the anointing (1 John 2:27). Therefore, to receive the anointing, one must be regenerated and have a clean conscience. 

In Luke 4:18, the Lord reads Isaiah 61 which equates the Spirit of the Lord being upon Him and His being anointed. Christ means "anointed One" and is the most used title of the Lord. 

1 John 2:20 tells the readers that they have an anointing from the Holy One, and verse 27 elaborates that this anointing teaches concerning all things. This is not a physical anointing, but the anointing of the Holy Spirit (Acts 10:38). Rather than saying the Spirit abides, John says that the anointing abides. These two are the one and the same as the anointing oil is the compound Spirit.

The Spirit’s anointing adds the elements of the aforementioned holy anointing oil, which signifies the all-inclusive Christ. Furthermore, as the new element is added, the old element is discharged or killed, as signified by the myrrh and cinnamon, which signify the death of Christ.

It Revelation 3:18, the Lord beseeches the saints in Laodicea to come to Him and buy eye salve to anoint their eyes. 

## Teaching of the Anointing

The anointing then passes through the conscience and intuition to become the the feeling of the conscience and teaching of the anointing respectively. The feeling of the conscience is to differentiate between good and evil, while the teaching of the anointing is related to the will of God Himself. Caring only about the conscience can lead to a faultless Christian, but God wants to become one with man, that man can understand the mind of God. Likewise, the conscience convicts negative things, while the teaching of the anointing is to lead toward a positive move.

The teaching of the anointing can give someone a revelation, a vision, and or simply a feeling regarding a certain decision such as marriage. This requires the interpretation of the intuition of the spirit by the mind in the soul, however it is not purely natural human ideation. This teaching is not necessarily a definite verbal confirmation or denial heard with English words, but an inward feeling.
