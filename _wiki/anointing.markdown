## Background

The anointing refers to God as the Holy Spirit applying the very element of God Himself to the believers, which produces a particular sense through the spirit's function of intuition. In the Bible, the anointing always follows the blood (Lev. 14:14-18).  

## Leading

The anointing is the Spirit, and the Spirit leads us. This trumps any prior human preparation.
