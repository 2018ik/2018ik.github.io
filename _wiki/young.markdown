## Background

When God calls people, He usually calls young people. During Stephen's martyrdom, his garments were laid at the feet of a *young* man called Saul (Acts 7:58). Peter, Andrew, James and John were also called when they were young. When we are old, we tend to be set, settled and occupied; it is difficult to have change from within. 

When we exercise our spirit, we become like a little child (Luke 18:17), which allows us to open up to new thoughts. For example, whatever we say to kids they will pretty much just believe it. This is how we should open up to God's speaking.

Whenever God calls us, he always has something new to do. He has a desire to turn the age which requires something revolutionary. This is why we need a new start with the Lord every day - this it to be young in our spirit.

The Lord doesn't need spiritual giants, he needs little captives. We need to pray for the Lord to conquer us and to never let us win, and to defeat us all the time. Ironically in God's eternal economy, our defeat means we are winning.

## Burden

Our burden for the young people should be for them to love the Lord and enjoy the Lord and enjoy the Lord and love the Lord.
