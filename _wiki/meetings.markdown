##  Background

The **meetings** are where God's economy can be carried out and where He can obtain His practical expression. There are many types of meetings in which believers meet at, such as Lord's table meetings, prophesying meetings, prayer meetings, gospel meetings, home meetings, and group meetings.There are small meetings which go from house to house, as well as big meetings in the local churches. In these meetings, believers come together with what they have experienced and enjoyed of Christ in their daily life for corporate worship to exhibit Christ.

## Significance

Christians not only need a personal, vertical fellowship with God, but also horizontal fellowship with other fellow believers. The Lord is not looking for spiritual giants, but the church, the gathering of the called out ones. 

When believers are gathered, the Lord is in their midst (Matt 18:20). When the believers pray, the Lord is praying. When the believers speak, the Lord is speaking in their speaking. This speaking issues in the hearing of faith that all can receive more life and be encouraged (Rom. 1:11-12; Gal. 3:2). In the meetings, Jesus the Son of God is doing in each one's doing; all are One in Christ. In a sense, a meeting of 50 technically has 51 in their midst, as the Lord Jesus is ever-present.

### Instrinsic Significance

Coming to the meetings requires a vision of all that the processed Triune God went through, and the realization that the self, flesh and natural man have been terminated in order that the meeting can be in resurrection and in ascension.

## Practice

Attendees must exercise their spirit so as to not exercise their natural speaking. When one speaks in themselves, in the natural life and in the flesh, they do not build up the Body. 

Furthermore, one must see that they are sons of the Father, and that they are in the Father's house and in His presence. The Father is happy when one talks about all that He is, all that He has done, all that He has given us, all that He is intending to do for us, and all that we have inherited of Him.
