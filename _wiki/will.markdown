## Background

The will is the part of the soul which can choose, refuse and decide. When one sets their heart to do something, that is an exercise of the will. 

## Significance

It is a Christian's choice to choose the Lord. According to God's principle of free will, He does not impose Himself on man to force him to choose life or death (as seen in the creation of man). 

## Biblical Basis

### The Soul

Job 7:15 says that the soul can *choose* strangulation. In Job 6:7, we see that the soul can also refuse. 1 Chron. 22:19 shows that the soul can seek after Jehovah. Numbers 30 also talks about binding one's soul, which in context we can see is a matter of making a vow, which is to do with man's will. The Hebrew word *soul* is also occasionally translated into *will* based on context (Psa. 27:12; 41:2).
