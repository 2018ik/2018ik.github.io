## Background

The will is the part of the soul which can choose, refuse and decide. When one sets their heart to do something, that is an exercise of the will.

## Significance



## Biblical Basis

### The Soul

We see in Job 7:15 that the soul can *choose* strangulation. In Job 6:7, we see that the soul can also refuse. 1 Chron. 22:19 shows that the soul can seek after Jehovah. Numbers 30 also talks about binding one's soul, which in context we can see is a matter of making a vow, which is to do with man's will. The Hebrew word *soul* is also occasionally translated into *will* based on context (Psa. 27:12; 41:2).
