## Background

The **one accord** (Greek: *homothumadon*) is the practice of oneness; for a group of people to be in one accord implies the inward parts (mind, emotion, will) are all the same. This practice is not an outward oneness, i.e. everyone is physically doing the same thing, but an inward oneness. The basis of the one accord is to see the vision of the age. As a spontaneous issuing of seeing this vision, the one accord is therefore not a method to practice it simply means we are attuned to the Lord's heart.

Today's Christianity has a severe lacking of the one accord. There are so many denominations - why is it so difficult for there to be oneness? It is because there is no holding line, no single teaching which holds everyone together. Everyone's preferred practices becomes a dividing factor; it is very easy to find a church that agrees with one's viewpoint or leave a church which disagrees. Therefore everyone must be held under the one vision the age and enter into the ministry of this age. 

In the book of Acts, the 120 were of one accord - thinking the same thing, same purposes, same will. When there is this kind of one accord, the blessing comes. They prayed for 10 days, and the Spirit poured out upon the Body of Christ, which brought forth the churches. Furthermore, the 3000 which were saved then continued steadfastly in the apostle's teaching.

The one accord is what brings us into the proper coordination. We will have an invincible morale, and we will march over all obstacles (Rom. 15:5). If we don't have the one accord, we can have all the good services and group meetings, but it is empty and without reality. 

## Vision

Since we are all governed by one heavenly vision, we only have one teaching, one practice, one thinking to produce one Body as the testimony to the Lord. Seeing this vision is therefore the basis for our one accord.

## Oneness vs One Accord

Ephesians mentions one body, spirit, hope, Lord, faith, baptism, God and Father of all. This clearly defines the oneness. 

The one accord is the practice of the oneness of the body, which is the oneness of the spirit.

## Dealing with others

It is easy to offend others. Apparently sisters are easily offended when the wrong words are spoken. In all of our services, we must have the one accord. If we all have different opinions regarding preaching the gospel, it is easy to offend others. We should stand with each other and forget about what we think.

## Tabernacle

The entire tribe served the tabernacle, and it was honor to serve. This was not just to get things done, but to participate in God's work. To serve in any capacity is a mercy.
