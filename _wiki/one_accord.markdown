## Background

Some greek translation (homothumadon) - the inward parts (mind, emotion, will) are all the same. This is not an outward oneness, i.e. we are all doing the same thing, but an inward oneness. 

In the book of Acts, the 120 were of one accord - thinking the same thing, same purposes, same will. When there is this kind of one accord, the blessing comes. They prayed for 10 days, and the Spirit poured out upon the Body of Christ, which brought forth the churches.

If we don't have the one accord, we can have all the good services and group meetings, but it is empty and without reality. 

The one accord is what brings us into the proper coordination.

## Oneness vs One Accord

Ephesians mentions one body, spirit, hope, Lord, faith, baptism, God and Father of all. This clearly defines the oneness. 

The one accord is the practice of the oneness of the body, which is the oneness of the spirit.

## Dealing with others

It is easy to offend others. Apparently sisters are easily offended when the wrong words are spoken. In all of our services, we must have the one accord. If we all have different opinions regarding preaching the gospel, it is easy to offend others. We should stand with each other and forget about what we think.

## Tabernacle

The entire tribe served the tabernacle, and it was honor to serve. This was not just to get things done, but to participate in God's work. To serve in any capacity is a mercy.

## Harmony

In a symphony there are many instruments, and all must tune to the correct temperament so that when they play, everything will be in harmony. Likewise, we all must be attuned to the same mind and to the same opinion (1 Cor 1).

The matter of the one accord is not a one-time thing, we all must constantly be re-tuned. We must allow the Lord to adjust and calibrate us.
