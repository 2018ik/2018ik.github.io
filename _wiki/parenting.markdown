## Background

Proper parenting is responsible for the next generation of the church. The main things parents should do is nourish their children in the teaching and admonition of the Lord and to not provoke them to anger or discourage them. Parents must exercise self control and must not be loose in any way, that is, they should have a proper person and living. God has committed the children to us, so we must set a high standard among ourselves regarding conduct, morality, judgments, spiritual matters, etc.

## Significance

God has entrusted a human body, along with its soul and spirit to the parents. The parents have their children before them every day, thus the children learn their ways primarily from their parents, not the church. One's children will do what their parents do, and say what their parents say. It is not pratical to need to rescue the children back from the world when they are older; keeping the next generation in the church is the parent's practical responsibility in God's economy.

## Keys

### Self-Living

Children are always observing what their parents are doing, and try to copy them. Parents must have a strict living in order not to set a bad pattern for their children. Actually, the most formative years of a child are the first two years; whether or not they can recall any events, these events actually shape what kind of person they are. 

### Self-Strictness

One should restrict themselves from doing many things that they can do. If one cannot even restrict themselves, they surely cannot restrict their children. 

### Double Standards

Parents should not set double standards for themselves and their children in matters of conduct. For example, limiting the children's television time, while watching infinite television themselves. The same standard should be set for all, otherwise it may stumble the children. 

### Electronic Devices

The convenient form of parenting today is to just give them a device. But it is clear as day that these devices damage the young generation (studies pending).

### Accurate Words

Parents should not make empty promises; do not promise anything that cannot be fulfilled. This disappoints the child, and teaches the child to not trust their parents. Every word must be reliable. One should also not exaggerate to their children.

Likewise, whatever parents instruct their children to do, it must be realistic. The child should also be expected to follow such instructions, and to face reasonable consequences when they fail to abide. This teaches them that there are consequences to one's actions.

### Children Lie

Remember that children lie all the time; this is human nature. 

### Admit Mistakes

When a parent makes a mistake especially in what they say, they must stand before their child and admit that they made a mistake. In this manner, one can train their children to sanctify their words. This can be a culture shock as some parents have the concept to never apologize to their children, but actually, it is evitable that parents make mistakes. They may not be ethically wrong, but they may fail to properly express God in their household. Thus, they must apologize to their children when they are wrong.

### Deal With Pride

Children should not be given excessive praise, so as to build up their pride. They should be humbled, so as to understand that they are not nothing and God is everything.

### God's Mercy

In the end, one must entrust their children to God's mercy. Even Samuel, someone who had essentially no negative things written about him, had children who did not follow his ways (1 Sam. 8:3). However, it is still absolutely the parent's responsibility for their child's upbringing.

## Mutual Perfection
Children are actually the spirit's helper - they serve likewise to transform the parents, that they may be perfected.
