## Background

The **true vine** in John 15 represents the Son as the vine which along with His branches shows an organic union between God and man. The branches live by the life of the vine and the vine flows its life through the branches and bears fruit through the branches. 

## Significance

## Cut off

To be cut off as in 15:2 and 15:6 is not to lose one's salvation, but to be cut off from the enjoyment of the riches of Christ. This also results in a severing from the fellowship with the vine and its other branches. When a branch is cut off, it loses its function and is unable to bear fruit.

## Vine of the Earth

The Lord Jesus calls Himself the true vine in contrast to the vine of the earth in Revelation 14:18. This vine of the earth is cast into the "great winepress of the fury of God." We were originally joined to the earthly vine of the old man, sin, death and Satan. As a result of our regeneration, we are detached from the vine of the earth and joined to the true vine of Christ.
