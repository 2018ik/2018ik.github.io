## Background

The **true vine** in John 15 represents a corporate organism of the Son as the vine and the believers as the branches joined together in an organic union. The branches live by the life of the vine and the vine flows its life through the branches and bears fruit through the branches. The branches are in the vine and part of the vine, and the totality of the vine also includes the branches. This is a similar relationship to Christ [being both the Head and the Body](../corporate_christ) in the Body of Christ.

## Significance

There are many depictions of the Lord's relationship with man in the Bible, but the vine and its branches is the most organic, personal and intimate one. It is difficult to distinguish the vine from its branches as the two grow together as one entity. 

In a sense, this vine is God's economy. God is not interested in worldly affairs, He is only interested in growing this vine, which is Christ. As a farmer's economy is growing their crops, God's economy is growing His vine. You could say that God's economy is the Christ-growing business.

## Abiding

Abiding means to remain, stay or dwell in place. in the vine means that we are receiving the dispensing of the riches of the Triune God.

## Cut off

To be cut off as in 15:2 and 15:6 is not to lose one's salvation, but to be cut off from the enjoyment of the riches of Christ. This also results in a severing from the fellowship with the vine and its other branches. When a branch is cut off, it loses its function and is unable to bear fruit.

## Vine of the Earth

The Lord Jesus calls Himself the true vine in contrast to the vine of the earth in Revelation 14:18. This vine of the earth is cast into the "great winepress of the fury of God." We were originally joined to the earthly vine of the old man, sin, death and Satan. As a result of our regeneration, we are detached from the vine of the earth and joined to the true vine of Christ.
