## Background

The **true vine** in John 15 represents the Son as the vine which along with His branches shows an organic union between God and man. The branches live by the life of the vine and the vine flows its life through the branches and bears fruit through the branches. 

## Significance

## Cut off

To be cut off as in 15:2 and 15:6 is not to lose one's salvation, but to be cut off from the enjoyment of the riches of Christ. This also results in a severing from the fellowship with the vine and its other branches. When a branch is cut off, it loses its function and is unable to bear fruit.
