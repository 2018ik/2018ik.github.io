## Background

God's economy is to dispense the Triune God into His chosen and redeemed people to be their life and everything that they might be regenerated and transformed into the proper material for the building up of the Body of Christ that God may have a corporate expression on earth in many localities in this age with a view to the building up of the coming New Jerusalem for His eternal expression.

## Etymology

The Greek word for economy is composed of two words which when combined mean "household law" or "household administration."

1. *oikos* = "house" or "home"
2. *nomos* = "law"

This is commonly translated as "stewardship" or "dispensation" (Eph. 1:10, 3:9; 1 Tim. 1:4).
Just like how a household administration comprises of a plan to distribute resources throughout the household, God's economy consists of a plan to dispense Himself into His chosen people so that He might have a household to express Himself.

## Steps

### Dispensing

First, God dispenses Himself by means of the divine trinity. The source is the Father, the course is through the Son, and the instrument and sphere is the Spirit. That is, the dispensing is *of* the Father, *through* the Son and *in* the Spirit.

### Church

The dispensing of God into man produces the church, the kingdom of god (1 Cor. 4:17, 20). 

### New Jerusalem

The church as the Body of Christ consummates in the New Jerusalem, the bride of Christ, at the end of this age (Rev. 21:2).

## New Testament Economy

The content of God's entire New Testament economy in His complete salvation is Christ as the Son of Man cherishing us and as the Son of God nourishing us.

## Eternal economy 

God becoming man that man might become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead is the essence of the entire Bible, the "diamond in the box" of the bible, the eternal economy of God.
