## Background

God's economy is to dispense the Triune God into His chosen and redeemed people to be their life and everything that they might be regenerated and transformed into the proper material for the building up of the Body of Christ that God may have a corporate expression on earth in many localities in this age with a view to the building up of the coming New Jerusalem for His eternal expression.

## New Testament Economy

The content of God's entire New Testament economy in His complete salvation is Christ as the Son of Man cherishing us and as the Son of God nourishing us.

## Eternal economy 

God becoming man that man might become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead is the essence of the entire Bible, the "diamond in the box" of the bible, the eternal economy of God.
