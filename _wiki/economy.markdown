## Background

God's economy is to dispense the Triune God into His chosen and redeemed people to be their life and everything that they might be regenerated and transformed into the proper material for the building up of the Body of Christ that God may have a corporate expression on earth in many localities in this age with a view to the building up of the coming New JErusalem for His eternal expression.
