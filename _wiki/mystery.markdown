## Background

The Bible contains many **mysteries** which cannot be comprehended by one's mind (John 16:12). These mysteries can only be realized through the Spirit of reality (John 16:13), which God has sent according to His will to make these things known (Col. 1:27; Eph. 3:9).

## Application

These mysteries can be understood through God's revelation. For example, Peter's affirmation that Jesus is the "Son of the living God" was through revelation. 

## Examples

### Christ

Christ is the mystery of God (Col. 2:2).

### The Church

The church is the mystery of Christ. We can't understand the church fully because the church is Christ (Eph. 3:4). 

### The Trinity

The divine Trinity which is both one and three cannot be understood with human thinking.

### God's Presence

Feeling God's direct presence, or from another believer, is a mystery.

### God's Kingdom

God's kingdom is not of this world; our riches are not of this world, yet they are real. 

### The Mingled Spirit

The union of God and man is a union of the two spirits, the Spirit of God and the spirit of man (2:11-14); tis union ist he deepest mystery in the Bible.
