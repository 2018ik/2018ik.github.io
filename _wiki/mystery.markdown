## Background

The Bible contains many mysteries which cannot be comprehended by our mind. 

## Application

These mysteries can be understood through God's revelation. Peter's affirmation that Jesus is the "Son of the living God" was through revelation. 

## Examples

### Christ

Christ is the mystery of God

### The Church

The church is the mystery of Christ. We can't understand the church fully because the church is Christ, and 

### The Trinity

The divine Trinity which is both one and three cannot be understood with human thinking.

### God's Presence

Feeling God's direct presence, or from another believer, is a mystery.

### God's Kingdom

God's kingdom is not of this world; our riches are not of this world, yet they are real.
