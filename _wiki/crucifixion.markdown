## Background

The significance of Christ's crucifixion is that He accomplished an all-inclusive death. This includes terminating the old creation (Rom. 6:6) as well as releasing the divine life as the basic factor of God's new creation.

## Being Made Alive

When Christ was being crucified, His physical body was dying, but His spirit was being made alive.
