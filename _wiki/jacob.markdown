## Background

## Significance

According to spiritual experience, Jacob and Joseph are one person. Jacob had the constitution of Christ in His maturity, while Joseph had the resigning aspect of maturity. 

## History

### Wrestling with God

God dislocating Jacob's thigh represents the loss in confidence of one's natural life, the thigh being one of the strongest muscles. At this point, his name was changed to Israel, which means one who struggles with God. This marked the beginning of his transformation.
