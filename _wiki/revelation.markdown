## Background

Revelation is God shining on the facts of the Bible. There is a curtain over the facts of the Bible, revelation lifts up this curtain so that we can see what is behind it. For the Lord's recovery, facts and knowledge are not good enough. We need a spirit of wisdom and revelation.

## Wisdom

Revelation goes hand-in-hand with wisdom (Eph. 1:??); we need wisdom as well as revelation. Neither of these items come from our natural mind, but our spirit.

## Age of Revelation

If you look at all the situation, it seems like it is imminent that the Lord is returning. 

## High Peak

When we speak of the "high peak of the divine revelation," we speak of the latest up-to-date revelation of God becoming man and man becoming God (in life and nature) in order to practice the God-ordained way according to His New Testament ministry.
