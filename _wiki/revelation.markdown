## Background

**Revelation** is God shining on the facts of the Bible. There is a veil over the facts of the Bible, revelation lifts up this curtain so that we can see what is behind it. For the Lord's recovery, facts and knowledge are not good enough. We need a spirit of wisdom and revelation. In other words, revelation is the spiritual or intrinsic significance of the facts of the Bible.

The Bible really has two parts: a box, and a diamond in it. A tragedy of immense proportion is that a great majority of believers treasure the box and pay attention to the box without loving and holding in high esteem the treasure in the box. The diamond in the box is nothing less than the high peak of the divine revelation concerning God's eternal economy: God becoming man to make man God in life and nature but not in the Godhead, for the building up of the Body of Christ which consummates the New Jerusalem. 

## Significance

Receiving revelation requires the operation of the Holy Spirit.

## Etymology

The word revelation in Greek is apokalupsis. Apo is to open, and kalupsis is a veil. Therefore, revelation simply means the removal of a veil. 

## Examples in the Bible

### Peter

Peter received revelation from the Father to know Jesus as Christ, the Son of the living God (Matt. 16:16). This is the only time Peter is referred to as "Simon Barjona" (Matt. 16:17) where Barjona means son of Jonah, and Jonah means *dove*, which typifies the Holy Spirit. 

### Paul

Paul saw the facts of the Old Testament, and the physical vision which he had experienced. However, the gospel that was announced to him he did not receive from man, nor was he taught it, but through a revelation by Jesus Christ (Gal. 1:11-12). 

## Wisdom

Revelation goes hand-in-hand with wisdom (Eph. 1:??); we need wisdom as well as revelation. Neither of these items come from our natural mind, but our spirit.

## High Peak

When we speak of the "high peak of the divine revelation," we speak of the latest up-to-date revelation of God becoming man and man becoming God (in life and nature) in order to practice the God-ordained way according to His New Testament ministry.

## Tips

How to receive revelation:

1. Turn our heart to the Lord for the removal of the veils
2. Be infants with a teachable spirit by being poor in heart
3. Be a spiritual man, not a fleshly or soulish man
4. Do not be a subjective person. Once a particular system of understanding has been instilled in us, we tend to focus on that rather than look at what is presented to us in an objective way. 
5. Love God
6. Be renewed in the spirit of our mind 
7. Have a thorough confession
8. Come to the Bible each day with the realization that we are coming to God
9. Singing, praying, pray-reading the Word
10. Prepare and speak prophecies 

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

> How did I come to see the truths in the Bible? First, it's because I love the Lord Jesus. There have been many brilliant scholars throughout history, but the deep and hidden things of God's economy are only for His lovers. We should pray "Lord Jesus I love you" before opening the Scriptures. Secondly, it's because I love the Bible. Thirdly, it's because I have studied and treasured the ministry of the Word.
