## Background

Revelation is God shining on the facts of the Bible. There is a curtain over the facts of the Bible, revelation lifts up this curtain so that we can see what is behind it. For the Lord's recovery, facts and knowledge are not good enough. We need a spirit of wisdom and revelation. In other words, revelation is the spiritual or instrinsic signifance of the facts of the Bible.

## Etymology



## Examples in the Bible

### Peter

Peter received revelation from the Father to know Jesus as Christ, the Son of the living God (Matt. 16:1?). 

### Paul



## Wisdom

Revelation goes hand-in-hand with wisdom (Eph. 1:??); we need wisdom as well as revelation. Neither of these items come from our natural mind, but our spirit.

## Age of Revelation

If you look at all the situation, it seems like it is imminent that the Lord is returning. 

## High Peak

When we speak of the "high peak of the divine revelation," we speak of the latest up-to-date revelation of God becoming man and man becoming God (in life and nature) in order to practice the God-ordained way according to His New Testament ministry.

## Tips

How to receive revelation:

1. Turn our heart to the Lord for the removal of the veils
2. Be infants with a teachable spirit by being poor in heart
3. Be a spiritual man, not a fleshly or soulish man
4. Do not be a subjective person. Once a particular system of understanding has been instilled in us, we tend to focus on that rather than look at what is presented to us in an objective way. 
5. Love God
6. Be renewed in the spirit of our mind 
7. Have a thorough confession
8. Come to the Bible each day with the realization that we are coming to God
9. Singing, praying, pray-reading the Word
