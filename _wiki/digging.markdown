## Background

Digging is for the removal of barriers which hinder the flow of the Spirit in man's spirit. These barriers are present in the heart, the gateway to the spirit.

There is a twofold work involved in digging away the dirt in one's being. On one hand, a person must turn their heart to God, on the other hand, God is the one who exposes and deals with all of the barriers. This is included in confession, which is essentially just agreeing with God's exposing and correcting.

## Significance

In a believer's spiritual experience, they may find themselves to be lacking the enjoyment of God they once had and feel dry or empty. To resolve this, they must take care of their heart, which requires awareness of their heart's condition. What man does is [take care of and deal with their heart](../dealing_with_heart), and God does everything else.

## Biblical Basis

In Numbers 21:16-18, Jehovah instructed the children of Israel to dig a well and sing to it. This well typifies Christ who indwells us, which springs up with water unto eternal life (John 4:14).
