## Background

Christ is **indwelling** the believers as the Spirit. When someone receives the Spirit, they also receive Christ, as well as the Father. The entire Triune God is dispensed into man at the same time.

## Biblical Basis

Three verses which explicitly state that Christ is in the believers is Romans 8:10, Colossians 1:27, and 2 Corinthians 13:5.

### Romans 8:10

>If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness.

The previous verse 9 says the Spirit of God dwells in man. This is the same Spirit as the Spirit of life in this verse and verse 2. For a Spirit of life to dwell in man is therefore to enliven man's deadened spirit. However, verse 10's condition specifically says "if **Christ** is in you." Therefore, the Spirit is in fact Christ Himself dwelling in man.

## Colossians 1:27

>To whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.

The mystery of God and the riches of His glory is actually Christ, who is in the believers.

### 2 Corinthians 13:5

>Test yourselves whether you are in the faith; prove yourselves; or do you not recognize yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?

Paul's test for whether or not someone has faith is whether or not they recognize that Christ dwells in them. Faith is for the facts to be substantiated and subjectively experienced by the believers (Heb. 11:1). Christ Jesus dwelling in man is a fact, but for man to recognize that Christ is in them is a matter of faith.

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

> My wife came to the first meting in the church in Houston and she hadn't been in the church life at all. So this brother that was caring for me said we better go see one of the elders right now. So I just thought she was a believer no problem. So we get with a leading brother and he and I were sittingh ere and I tell him all about my wife he listens and says you know this might be something of the Lord. The brother almost fell out of hischair. We were having a love feast and of course you know my wife is sitting over here way over and I'm praying Lord Jesus she goes into the kitchen to help the sisters prepare the food it was a love feast and the sister said to her what chruch are you from. She didnt know what that meant, what locality are you from? if you're regenerated that's your membership card. They got so poisoned by all the negative literature and I felt so bad that one time they came to visit us and I was there my in laws were there I"m in the living room with them I said just tell me what your problems are with us. As soon as I said that my wife and mother fled back to the back bedroom. Oh no what's going to happen here. And I said what's your problem with us. And he said well, my problem is with your view of the Triune God. And I said what's your view? And he said my view is that the three is distinct and separate. And I said you could say they are distinct but they are not separate. In john 10:11 he says do you not know that I am in father and father is in me. And he just went to the next topic. Then he said OK. You say christ is the spirit.

> I said, respsetfully you have to look at the context of this verse. The Lord is the Spirit verse 17, then verse 18, then chapter 4, one two three four five, six verses later, we preach Christ Jesus as Lord. So Christ Jesus the Lord is the Spirit. He said, well, he couldn't say anything. I didn't pull out my cruise missiles or anything I said look - you know that we're not like what those books say, look at us. What really helps is if you have kids as in laws/parents like grandkids. He says well you're different.

> Anyway my wife and mother in law came back in and after that, we had so much good fellowship after that. He fellowshipped more with me than anyone else in the family.I never made any issues but he realized I am following the Bible. And one time he said to me, how do you reconcile predestination with free will? And so I just repeated what D.L. Moody said when we come into the kingdom there is a sign that says whosoever will may come, and when you look back it says chosen before the foundation of the world.
