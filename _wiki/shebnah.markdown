## Background

**Shebnah** was a steward of Hezekiah, but not a particularly good one (Isa 22:16), and typifies the old man. He was fired, having been wound up and thrown by Jehovah to die in a far away place (Isa. 22:18), and replaced by Eliakim (Isa. 22:20).

## Significance

Shebnah's firing typifies Christ's all-inclusive death which terminated the entire old creation. Our old man has been crucified with Christ (Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20) and replaced with the new man. In every situation, one can pray for Jehovah to throw their natural man far away once more. In the natural man, one cannot fit into the church life to serve God. However, Christ can fit into every situation.
