## Background

Shebnah was a steward of Hezekiah, but not a particularily good one (Isa 22:16), and typifies the old man. He was fired, having been wound up and thrown by Jehovah to die in a far away place (Isa. 22:18), and replaced by Eliakim (Isa. 22:20).

## Significance

In every situation, one can pray for Jehovah to throw their natural man far away once more. In the natural man, one cannot fit into the church life, into the meetings, and to serve God. However, Christ can fit into every situation.
