## Background

**Christ's resurrection** was the beginning of the new creation. It produced the firstborn Son of god, the many sons of God, and Christ was made the life-giving Spirit. Furthermore, it regenerated us unto living hope, and made us alive together with Christ.

For a vast majority of Christians, resurrection is simply a historical process that Jesus underwent 2000 years ago. Seemingly the most significant aspect of resurrection is that it signifies Christ's complete victory of death, Hades and the grave. 

More prudent Christians may say according to Romans 4:25 He was raised for our justification. The fact that he was resurrected from the dead means that God received the death of the only begotten son on our behalf for the sufficient payment of the penalty of our sin. We have the receipt, the proof that God has accepted the death of Christ as an adequate payment for our sins which should have resulted in our own death.

However all of this falls short of the true significance of resurrection, which has to do with life. When Jesus was resurrected, He was regenerated (as well as all believers), reborn with the divine life of God.

## Significance

The typical understanding of Christ's resurrection is that:

1. One needs to believe that Jesus was raised from the dead to be saved (Rom. 10:10)
2. It was the magnificent and full victory over death, Hades and the grave (Rev. 1:18)
3. It proves God accepted Christ's death as justification for our sins (Rom. 4:25)

The problem with these three facts is that they have very little to do with the organic significance of Christ's resurrection for the fulfillment of God's eternal economy which is His endeavor to dispense Himself as the Spirit into our being so that He may gain an organism of Himself which is the Body which consummates the New Jerusalem.

Through the death, the shell of the Lord's humanity was broken and the divine life was released, and in resurrection, the divine life:

1. Designated Christ the Son of God in power
2. Produces the many grains as His reproduction
3. Transfigures from flesh to the life-giving Spirit
