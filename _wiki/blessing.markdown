## Background

**Blessing** is the overflow of God Himself. On the side of man, this overflow issues from maturity in life.

## Definitions

### Well-speaking

The word for "blessed" and "blessing" in Ephesians 1:3 is the Greek word anglicized *eulogy*. In its literal definition, this means to speak well of, praise with adoration, and is genuine praise. The whole New Testament is God's blessing, God's well-speaking to us. Likewise, to bless God is our well-speaking toward Him.

## God's Blessing

According to Ephesians 1:3, God has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ. The purpose of these blessings is to make us holy. The following verses 4 through 14 list all the blessings with which God has blessed us with.

| Blessing | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Chosen before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4) | This is God's predestination of His people to be saved and regenerated in eternity past to fulfill His purpose. |
| To be holy (Eph. 1:4) | God chose man to be holy, which implies all the elements of positional and dispositional sanctification. |
| Without blemish (Eph. 1:4) | To have no blemish is to have no mixture such as the flesh, self, the natural life or worldly things. |
| In love (Eph. 1:4) | The previous three blessings are in love; it is by God's love that His chosen ones become holy and without blemish before Him. |
