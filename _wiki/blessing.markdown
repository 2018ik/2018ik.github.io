## Background

**Blessing** is the overflow of God through maturity in life.

## Definitions

### Well-speaking

The word for "blessed" and "blessing" in Ephesians 1:3 is the Greek word anglicized *eulogy*. In its literal definition, this means to speak well of, praise with adoration, and is genuine praise. The whole New Testament is God's blessing, God's well-speaking to us. Likewise, to bless God is our well-speaking toward Him.
