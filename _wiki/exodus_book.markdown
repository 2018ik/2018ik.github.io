### Eating

There are three stages of eating in Exodus:

1. The lamb, signifying separation from the world.
2. Manna, signifying a reconstitution with the heavenly element
3. The produce of the good land, signifying Christ to live the Body life to fight the enemy and to build up God's corporate dwelling place
