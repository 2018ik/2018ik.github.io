## Background

**Fruit bearing** is a matter of the gospel illustrated by John 15, where believers are joined as branches to the Lord as the true vine in a life union and spontaneously bear fruit as a result of abiding in the vine. Although in Matthew, Mark and Luke the disciples are charged to preach and teach the nations, the final Gospel of John gives the final word on life. According to this parable, preaching the gospel with methods and teachings but without life amounts to absolutely nothing.

## Life

Fruit bearing being a matter of a life union with the Lord reveals many principles for the gospel:

1. It is a matter of the person, not the work. One needs to be filled with life first in order to have the outflow of life to bear fruit
2. Whe talking to people, one should have the full realization that they are abiding in the Lord and that their speaking is the Lord's speaking
3. Fruit bearing is a slow process of life; do not expect a rapid growth as that of leaven (Matt. 13:31-33)

## Commission to All

All believers are commissioned to bear fruit, that is to preach the gospel and bring new ones to the Lord. If one abides in the Lord and the Lord in him, he will bear much fruit, and those who do not abide can do nothing (John 15:5). Therefore, to not abide in the Lord is to not bear fruit and to be cast into fire (John 15:6), which is to lose the kingdom reward.

## Glorifying the Father

The Father is the source, and the Son glorifies the Father by expressing the Father. The Spirit is the realization of the Son; the disciples could not know truly know the Son nor abide in the Son prior to receiving the Spirit of reality (John 14:17). Then, as a result of the receiving the Spirit of life, the disciples could bear fruit, which expresses the Spirit. The Father is glorified by fruit bearing (John 15:8) because the fruit is the expression of the Spirit who is the reality of the Son who is the expression of the Father.
