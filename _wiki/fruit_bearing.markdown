## Background

**Fruit bearing** is a matter of the gospel illustrated by John 15, where believers are joined as branches to the Lord as the true vine, and spontaneously bear fruit as a result of this organic union.

All believers are commissioned to bear fruit, that is to preach the gospel and bring new ones to the Lord. If one abides in the Lord and the Lord in him, he will bear much fruit, and those who do not abide can do nothing (John 15:5). Therefore, to not abide in the Lord is to not bear fruit and to be cast into fire (John 15:6), which is to lose the kingdom reward.
