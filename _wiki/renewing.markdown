## Background

**Renewing** is the process in which the spirit enters the mind, issuing in one's entire being becoming new (Rom. 12:2; Phil. 2:5; 1 Cor. 2:16). In our daily living, we always tend towards our oldness, rather than God who is newness itself. Renewing is contingent on setting the mind on the spirit and having a strong spirit that can break through into the mind. This breaking is through the cross which in the only thing that can terminate oldness to produce the new creation (2 Cor. 5:17).

To be renewed, we must experience the cross. Resurrection life always follows the killing of the cross, which is a key component in renewing.

## Biblical Basis

Paul charges the believers to have the mind of the Christ (Phil. 2:5; 1 Cor. 2:16). The only way to accomplish this is by the renewing of the mind. Romans 12:2 and Ephesians 4:23 all speak particularly of a renewing in the *mind*. This is therefore to have one's way of thinking to be changed to that of God. This is an inward change which comes from God infusing Himself as the Spirit into the believers. Although renewing has an emphasis on the mind, the entire inner man is being renewed day by day (2 Cor. 4:16).

Key verses:

>And do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and well pleasing and perfect.

\- Rom. 12:2

>And *that* you be renewed in the spirit of your mind / And put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality.

\- Eph. 4:23-24

>Therefore we do not lose heart; but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner *man* is being renewed day by day.

\- 2 Cor. 4:16 

## Position in Organic Salvation

Renewing follows regeneration and dispositional sanctification and precedes transformation. It's clear based on Romans 12:2 that renewing issues in transformation. Logically, regeneration precedes DS as one needs to be born as a child of God first in order to grow. As dispositional sanctification includes one's entire organic salvation, renewing is placed after it. This does not mean that they are separate; DS always results in renewing, but renewing is included in DS, not vice versa. In other words, renewing is specific, DS is more general.

## Purpose

Believers were once sinners altogether of the old creation. Upon being saved, they are brought into the new creation. However, at this point one possesses both old and new natures. Renewing is to kill the old life and bring in more of the new life, such that eventually one becomes altogether of the new creation, of Christ. For example, regenerated believers receive a new heart (Ezek. 36:26). However, this heart can become hard, and lose the first love (Rev. 2:4). This could be ambition in the church, wanting to be somebody. It is in this way the Satan filled Ananias's heart (Acts 5:3). Even after being saved, one's mind must continually be renewed.

In many ways, we are still old. We may be messy, disagreeable, too fast, too slow or simply make mistakes. The new creation does not make mistakes and is always gentle, fine and careful.
