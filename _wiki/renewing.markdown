## Background

**Renewing** is the process in which one's mind is changed by the Spirit of truth with the revelation of the Scriptures, that Christ's mind would replace the mind through the consuming work of the cross (Titus 3:5; Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23; Rom. 8:6; Phil. 2:5; 2 Cor. 4:16). A renewed mind produces thoughts and virtues which are through the cross and by the spirit, for the purpose of ministering Christ for the building up of the Body.
