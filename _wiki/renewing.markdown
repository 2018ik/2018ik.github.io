## Background

**Renewing** is the process in which the new, divine life added to one's being through regeneration penetrates the mind, causing it to be changed and even to become the mind of Christ (Phil. 2:5; 1 Cor; 2:16). The Spirit mingled with the believers' spirit can spread into the mind through the cross which terminates the old, which produces thoughts and virtues which are through the cross and by the spirit, for the purpose of ministering Christ for the building up of the Body (Titus 3:5; Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23; Rom. 8:6; Phil. 2:5; 2 Cor. 4:16).
