## Background

**Renewing** is the process in which the divine life added to one's being through regeneration penetrates the mind, causing it to be inwardly changed and even to become the mind of Christ (Rom. 12:2; Phil. 2:5; 1 Cor; 2:16). The Spirit mingled with the believers' spirit can spread into the mind through the cross which terminates the old, which produces thoughts and virtues which are through the cross and by the spirit, for the purpose of ministering Christ for the building up of the Body (Titus 3:5; Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23; Rom. 8:6; Phil. 2:5; 2 Cor. 4:16).

## Purpose

When believers are regenerated, they receive a new heart. However, this heart can become hard, and lose the first love. This could be ambition in the church, wanting to be somebody. It is in this way the Satan filled Ananias's heart (Acts 5:3). Even after being saved, one's mind must continually be renewed.
