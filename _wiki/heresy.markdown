## Background

**Heresy** (Greek: *hairesis*) is a divisive opinion of doctrine different from that which is usually accepted: "self-chosen doctrines alien from the truth." Most occurrences of this word literally translates to "sect" e.g. the *hairesis* of the Sadducees (Acts 5:17). Thus, heresies are not simply misconceptions or wrong opinions, but *schools* of opinions whereby this opinion is taught and propagated in a systematic way so as to cause division and form sects.
