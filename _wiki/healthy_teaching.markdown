## Background

Paul charges Timothy to teach the healthy teaching (1 Tim. 6:3). These are teachings which are according to the apostles' teaching, and are healthy because they impart the Triune God into man. This implies growth, and also causes us to love the Lord more. Different teachings are unhealthy, and afford men no life supply and lead some to become shipwrecked regarding the faith (1 Tim. 1:19)

## History

Paul wrote his epistles to Timothy out of his concern for the unhealthy teaching in Ephesus and because of the mixture in the church in Jerusalem (Acts 20:29-31, 21:18-26). Some were not holding the healthy words, and had turned away from Paul's ministry (2 Tim. 1:13, 15).
