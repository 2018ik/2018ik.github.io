## Background

Paul charges Timothy to teach the **healthy teaching** (1 Tim. 6:3), which is teaching according to godliness. This is the same as the apostles' teaching, and are healthy because they impart the Triune God as life into man. This implies growth, and also causes us to love the Lord more. Different teachings and teachings which are dead letter are unhealthy, and afford men no life supply and lead some to become shipwrecked regarding the faith (1 Tim. 1:19). Many Christians today have received many teachings, yet are still poor because they have not received the healthy teaching.

1 Timothy 3:15-16 reveals that teaching according to godliness concerns God becoming flesh, passing through human living, dying and resurrecting to produce the church, which is God manifested in the flesh. So the healthy teaching covers the entire New Testament and the full ministry of Christ extending from Matthew to Revelation.

## History

Paul wrote his epistles to Timothy out of his concern for the unhealthy teaching in Ephesus and because of the mixture in the church in Jerusalem (Acts 20:29-31, 21:18-26). Some were not holding the healthy words, and had turned away from Paul's ministry (2 Tim. 1:13, 15).
