## Background

A **testament** is will given after someone has died (Heb. 9:16-17), and the Bible as old and new testaments contains all the riches which are bequeathed by God to His chosen people. God has a will for His people which contains infinite riches.The Lord died to enact the new testament, and He resurrected to *become* the new testament. 

In Greek, the same word is used for both *covenant* and *testament* and are often used synonymously (2 Cor. 3:6)
