## Background

**Lot** was Abraham's nephew and can be described as a defeated righteous man (2 Pet. 2:6-8); someone who despite knowing the truth is continually passive and never sought God for Himself. There is no indication that he ever took initiative of his own to follow God. 

## History

In chapter 13, Abraham went out of Egypt with Lot into the Negev and there was a problem with their herdsman. Abraham gave Lot the choice, and Lot journeyed east to the plain of Jordan, eventually moving his tent close to Sodom. Shortly after that, there was a war and the king of Sodom was captured along with Lot, and Abraham rescued him. 

## Significance

Lot was a righteous man, and never did anything obviously evil. He was simply passive and was living in the situation presented to him. We need God's mercy to see that the situation today in the world is the same, and we can passively remain or take the initiative to choose God. May the Lord have mercy on us.
