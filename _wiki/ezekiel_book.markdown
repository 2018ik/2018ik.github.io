### Clear Sky

Ezekiel 1 presents a picture of God's throne above the clear sky (Ezek. 1:22; 1:26). This clear sky like the sight of an awesome crystal represents a clear conscience, where there is nothing between man and God. The sapphire throne above the expanse means that the ruling of the throne is based on having a clear sky, that is a clear conscience.
