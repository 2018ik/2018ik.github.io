## Background

The **oracle** of God can refer to God's speaking, the persons carrying out God's speaking, or the place of God's speaking. 

## History

In the Old Testament, the high priest could enter into the Holy of Holies once a year and sprinkle blood on the propitiation cover of the Ark of the Covenant. Here, God could speak to the high priest.

In the New Testament, the speaking is Christ; the Son is the word of God. He is also the high priest. Furthermore, He is the propitiation place. Today, the life-giving Spirit in our Spirit makes us the new creation. When we come before the propitiation place in our Spirit, we not only receive the forgiveness of sins, but we also receive and are constituted with God's speaking. As a result, we become God's oracle.
