## Background

The **essential Trinity** is God existing within Himself. The Godhead only exists essentially; something that is true "in the Godhead" is also true "in the essential Trinity" (??? verify). 

In the essential Trinity,
1. He does not undergo change
2. He finds perfect delight in His Son who alone expressed God from eternity to eternity
3. He alone is a universal and eternal divine incorporation
4. He alone can participate in divinity
5. There is no difference in authority between the Son and Father (Phil. 2:6)
