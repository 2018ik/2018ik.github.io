>"The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God."

\- Rom. 8:16

## Background

The basic understanding that man has a human spirit is required for understanding the New Testament. The same word "spirit" is used to describe both the human and divine spirits, where "spirit" can be uppercase or lowercase in a particular verse to specify which spirit.

Our regenerated human spirit is the key to everything in the Christian life, as that is where God is. In everything we do, we should ask ourselves: "Am I doing this in spirit?"

## Location

Hebrews 4:12 reveals that the human soul and spirit need to be divided. We see a type of this in the Old Testament in the temple with its outer court, Holy place, and Holy of Holies. Likewise, we see a type of this in the children of Israel going out of Egypt, through the wilderness and entering into the good land. When we are not contacting God and receiving His word, the spirit is covered and difficult to distinguish from the soul. 

Why does Paul use the subjunctive mood ("the Lord *be* with your Spirit" - 2 Tim. 4:22) rather than asserting that "the Lord *is* with your Spirit." That is because the Lord's being with our Spirit is dependent on our relationship with Him. He could be *in* our spirit but not *with* our spirit. 

## Function

### Residence of the Divine Spirit

The Spirit of God dwells in us (2 Tim. 4:22), i.e. makes His home in us. If we are in our spirit, the Spirit of God dwells in us, but if we are not, there is a sense that the Spirit is not dwelling, which indicates a certain quality of experiencing the Spirit. Our experience of Christ goes up when we care about this experience.

## Distractions

The enemy (Satan and his angels) will try at all-costs to distract us from our spirit, because when we are in the spirit, he has no ground in us. The first time Satan attempted to draw man away from the tree of life, the argument he posed was that the fruit was good to eat, will give knowledge, and make oneself wise (Gen. 3:5). This is the same as today; he distracts us through these three things, all of which are not inherently evil: the desire to do good, doctrine, and gifts. 

### To Do Good

Satan tempts us to live by the wrong tree, and to live by the law of good in our mind. If we attempt to live by this law of good, it is inevitable that we will die (Rom. 7:21).

### Doctrines

Doctrine can be scriptural knowledge and bring us into dead letters, or it can bring us into Christ in our spirit to experience Him as life.

### Gifts

Sometimes God needs something to be done, or a particular member of body is short, so He gives them some kind of gift. We have to grow to the point where gift or not, we exercise our faith to touch the spirit. The gifts are to bring us to the key, our human spirit. Anything the gifts do beyond that will result in division.
