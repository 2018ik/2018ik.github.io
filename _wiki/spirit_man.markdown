>"The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God."

\- Rom. 8:16

## Background

The **spirit** is the innermost part of the man, and consists of the conscience, intuition and fellowship. Man's spirit is distinct from the soul (Heb. 4:12; 1 Thes. 5:23), and the spirit is the only way through which man can contact God. The [regenerated human spirit](../regeneration) is the key to everything in the Christian life, as it is the single point of connection between God and man (1 Cor. 6:17). This is typified by the house of God at Bethel, which is the gate of heaven where Christ is the ladder that joins earth to heaven and brings heaven to earth (Gen. 28:12-17; John 1:51). Today the spirit as God's habitation joins the people on earth to heaven with Christ as the ladder.

Having been uniquely created with a spirit, man is separated from animal. Satan throughout church history has strategically veiled the existence of the human spirit (despite its clear record in the Bible) so that man is separated from God and Christianity becomes a religion form. 

The same word "spirit" (Greek: *pneuma*) is used to describe both the human and divine spirits, where it is up to the translator whether to use the capital Spirit or lowercase spirit respectively.

## Significance 

Below is a non-exhaustive list of items which show the importance of the human spirit:

1. It is ranked with the heavens and the earth (Zech. 12:1; Isa. 42:5). Actually, the heavens and the earth are *for* the spirit. Given the earth is subservient to man (Gen. 1:26; Heb. 2:5) and angels are inferior to the seed of Abraham which includes the believers (Heb. 2:16; Gal. 3:29), it is by virtue of the human spirit that we are second place in the universe besides God.
2. The spirit is needed for worshipping God (John 4:24).
3. Christ as the Spirit indwells man's spirit (2 Tim. 4:22a; Rom. 8:11; Eph. 2:22) and is one with man's spirit (1 Cor. 6:17).
4. The Christian walk, that is the daily Christian living, is a walk that is in spirit (Rom. 8:4).
5. Service to God must be in spirit (Rom. 1:9; Rom. 12:11).
6. It is only by the spirit of man that he can discern himself and even all things (1 Cor. 2:11, 15).

Evidently, God's purpose in creation which is His economy cannot be fulfilled without the human spirit. The heavens were created for the earth, which was created for man's spirit (Zech. 12:1).

To not use the spirit to contact God is akin to using the entirely wrong organ to accomplish certain things (e.g. trying to see with the ears). One cannot contact God through their body or their soul. Even diligently studying the Bible, or being extremely in love with the Lord in one's emotions will serve no benefit without the exercise of the spirit. This is because when one is saved, their spirit is joined to the Lord in one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). So in order for this Spirit to do anything, one must turn to their spirit.

## Biblical Basis

Many verses in the Bible indicate that there is the Spirit of God as well as a spirit of man, sometimes even in the same verse. 

Romans 8:16 says that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit, indicating that there is both a Spirit of God and a spirit of man. Hebrews 4:12 draws a distinction between the soul and spirit, and 1 Thessalonians 5:23 shows that man has a spirit, soul and body.

1 Corinthians 2:11 mentions the spirit of man, except this verse also personifies the spirit with the pronoun "who," indicating a mingling of the Spirit of God with our spirit, in which there is a person present in man's spirit.

In the Old Testament, there are types which illustrate the three parts of man. For example, the temple or tabernacle as the dwelling place of God has three sections, and is also directly indicated by Jesus who referred to Himself as a temple (John 2:19-21). In the creation record of Adam, God formed him from the dust of the ground, indicating the Body. Then, He breathed into Him the breath of life, indicating the Spirit. Then, man became a living soul, indicating the soul.

When the Spirit of God dwells in man (2 Tim. 4:22), the dwelling place is the human spirit. This is typified by the Holy of Holies; when one enters the Holy of Holies today, they are entering into their spirit (Heb. 10:19).

## Parts of the Spirit

### Conscience

Romans 9:1 states "My conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit." We know the Holy Spirit witnesses with our human spirit, which allows our conscience to witness in the Holy Spirit, in our conscience. 

In 1 Corinthians 5:3 the apostle Paul says that in his spirit he judged a sinful person. To judge means either to condemn or to justify, which are acts of the conscience. This confirms that the condemning or justifying function is in the spirit; hence, the conscience is in the spirit. 

Psalm 51:10 speaks of "a right spirit within me" and Psalm 34:18 speaks of being "contrite in spirit." Knowing right from wrong is related to the conscience.

Deuteronomy 2:30 shows that man can harden his spirit, which means that the conscience was hardened. When we cast off the feeling in the conscience, we become hardened in the spirit.

### Fellowship

John 4:24 tells us that we must worship God in our spirit, and Romans 1:9 shows that Paul serves God in his spirit. To worship and serve God is a type of fellowship with God. 

Ephesians 6:18 says, "Praying at every time in spirit." There is no article before spirit, nor is it capitalized. It does not mean the Holy Spirit but our human spirit. To pray means to fellowship with God. 

Luke 1:47 says, "My spirit has exulted in God." This means that the human spirit has contacted God. Once again, fellowship with God is a function in the spirit. 

Romans 8:16 says, "The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit" and 1 Corinthians 6:17 says "He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit." Fellowship with God must be both in our spirit and in the Spirit of God. 

### Intuition

1 Corinthians 2:11 reveals that the spirit of man can know what the soul cannot, indicating that an extra discernment is in our spirit. Our soul can know things by facts and logic, but the human spirit can discern things without these. This direct sense shows that the intuition is in our spirit. 

Mark 2:8 says "Knowing fully in His spirit." The knowing of the spirit is a different knowing then that of the mind, which is beyond natural human understanding. This is the intuition of our human spirit.

## Location

Hebrews 4:12 reveals that the human soul and spirit need to be divided. We see a type of this in the Old Testament in the temple with its outer court, Holy place, and Holy of Holies. Likewise, we see a type of this in the children of Israel going out of Egypt, through the wilderness and entering into the good land. When we are not contacting God and receiving His word, the spirit is covered and difficult to distinguish from the soul. 

Why does Paul use the subjunctive mood ("the Lord *be* with your Spirit" - 2 Tim. 4:22) rather than asserting that "the Lord *is* with your Spirit." That is because the Lord's being with our Spirit is dependent on our relationship with Him. He could be *in* our spirit but not *with* our spirit. 

## Distractions

The enemy (Satan and his angels) will try at all-costs to distract us from our spirit, because when we are in the spirit, he has no ground in us. The first time Satan attempted to draw man away from the tree of life, the argument he posed was that the fruit was good to eat, will give knowledge, and make oneself wise (Gen. 3:5). This is the same as today; he distracts us through these three things, all of which are not inherently evil: the desire to do good, doctrine, and gifts. 

### To Do Good

Satan tempts us to live by the wrong tree, and to live by the law of good in our mind. If we attempt to live by this law of good, it is inevitable that we will die (Rom. 7:21).

### Doctrines

Doctrine can be scriptural knowledge and bring us into dead letters, or it can bring us into Christ in our spirit to experience Him as life.

### Gifts

Sometimes God needs something to be done, or a particular member of body is short, so He gives them some kind of gift. We have to grow to the point where gift or not, we exercise our faith to touch the spirit. The gifts are to bring us to the key, our human spirit. Anything the gifts do beyond that will result in division.
