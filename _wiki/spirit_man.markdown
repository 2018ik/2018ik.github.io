>"The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God."

\- Rom. 8:16

## Background

The spirit is the innermost part of the man, and consists of the functions of the conscience, intuition and fellowship.

The basic understanding that man has a human spirit is required for understanding the New Testament. The same word "spirit" is used to describe both the human and divine spirits, where "spirit" can be uppercase or lowercase in a particular verse to specify which spirit.

Our regenerated human spirit is the key to everything in the Christian life, as that is where God is. In everything we do, we should ask ourselves: "Am I doing this in spirit?"

## Biblical Basis

Many verses in the Bible indicate that there is the Spirit of God as well as a spirit of man, sometimes even in the same verse. 

Romans 8:16 says that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit, indicating that there is both a Spirit of God and a spirit of man. Hebrews 4:12 draws a distinction between the soul and spirit, and 1 Thessalonians shows that man has a spirit, soul and body.

The following sections on the three functions of the spirit contain verses which prove there is a human spirit.

### Conscience

Romans 9:1 states "My conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit." We know the Holy Spirit witnesses with our human spirit, which allows our conscience to witness in the Holy Spirit, in our conscience. 

In 1 Corinthians 5:3 the apostle Paul says that in his spirit he judged a sinful person. To judge means either to condemn or to justify, which are acts of the conscience. This confirms that the condemning or justifying function is in the spirit; hence, the conscience is in the spirit. 

Psalm 51:10 speaks of "a right spirit within me" and Psalm 34:18 speaks of being "contrite in spirit." Knowing right from wrong is related to the conscience.

Deuteronomy 2:30 shows that man can harden his spirit, which means that the conscience was hardened. When we cast off the feeling in the conscience, we become hardened in the spirit.

### Fellowship

John 4:24 tells us that we must worship God in our spirit, and Romans 1:9 shows that Paul serves God in his spirit. To worship and serve God is a type of fellowship with God. 

Ephesians 6:18 says, "Praying at every time in spirit." There is no article before spirit, nor is it capitalized. It does not mean the Holy Spirit but our human spirit. To pray means to fellowship with God. 

Luke 1:47 says, "My spirit has exulted in God." This means that the human spirit has contacted God. Once again, fellowship with God is a function in the spirit. 

Romans 8:16 says, "The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit" and 1 Corinthians 6:17 says "He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit." Fellowship with God must be both in our spirit and in the Spirit of God. 

### Intuition

1 Corinthians 2:11 reveals that the spirit of man can know what the soul cannot, indicating that an extra discernment is in our spirit. Our soul can know things by facts and logic, but the human spirit can discern things without these. This direct sense shows that the intuition is in our spirit. 

Mark 2:8 says "Knowing fully in His spirit." The knowing of the spirit is a different knowing then that of the mind, which is beyond natural human understanding. This is the intuition of our human spirit.

## Location

Hebrews 4:12 reveals that the human soul and spirit need to be divided. We see a type of this in the Old Testament in the temple with its outer court, Holy place, and Holy of Holies. Likewise, we see a type of this in the children of Israel going out of Egypt, through the wilderness and entering into the good land. When we are not contacting God and receiving His word, the spirit is covered and difficult to distinguish from the soul. 

Why does Paul use the subjunctive mood ("the Lord *be* with your Spirit" - 2 Tim. 4:22) rather than asserting that "the Lord *is* with your Spirit." That is because the Lord's being with our Spirit is dependent on our relationship with Him. He could be *in* our spirit but not *with* our spirit. 

## Function

### Residence of the Divine Spirit

The Spirit of God dwells in us (2 Tim. 4:22), i.e. makes His home in us. If we are in our spirit, the Spirit of God dwells in us, but if we are not, there is a sense that the Spirit is not dwelling, which indicates a certain quality of experiencing the Spirit. Our experience of Christ goes up when we care about this experience.

## Distractions

The enemy (Satan and his angels) will try at all-costs to distract us from our spirit, because when we are in the spirit, he has no ground in us. The first time Satan attempted to draw man away from the tree of life, the argument he posed was that the fruit was good to eat, will give knowledge, and make oneself wise (Gen. 3:5). This is the same as today; he distracts us through these three things, all of which are not inherently evil: the desire to do good, doctrine, and gifts. 

### To Do Good

Satan tempts us to live by the wrong tree, and to live by the law of good in our mind. If we attempt to live by this law of good, it is inevitable that we will die (Rom. 7:21).

### Doctrines

Doctrine can be scriptural knowledge and bring us into dead letters, or it can bring us into Christ in our spirit to experience Him as life.

### Gifts

Sometimes God needs something to be done, or a particular member of body is short, so He gives them some kind of gift. We have to grow to the point where gift or not, we exercise our faith to touch the spirit. The gifts are to bring us to the key, our human spirit. Anything the gifts do beyond that will result in division.
