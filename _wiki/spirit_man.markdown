>"The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God."

\- Rom. 8:16

## Background

The basic understanding that man has a human spirit is required for understanding the New Testament. The same word "spirit" is used to describe both the human and divine spirits, where "spirit" can be uppercase or lowercase in a particular verse to specify which spirit.

## Location

Hebrews 4:12 reveals that the human soul and spirit need to be divided. We see a type of this in the Old Testament in the temple with its outer court, Holy place, and Holy of Holies. Likewise, we see a type of this in the children of Israel going out of Egypt, through the wilderness and entering into the good land. When we are not contacting God and receiving His word, the spirit is covered and difficult to distinguish from the soul. 

Why does Paul use the subjunctive mood ("the Lord *be* with your Spirit" - 2 Tim. 4:22) rather than asserting that "the Lord *is* with your Spirit." That is because the Lord's being with our Spirit is dependent on our relationship with Him. He could be *in* our spirit but not *with* our spirit. 

## Function

### Residence of the Divine Spirit

The Spirit of God dwells in us, i.e. makes His home in us. If we are in our spirit, the Spirit of God dwells in us, but if we are not, there is a sense that the Spirit is not dwelling, which indicates a certain quality of experiencing the Spirit. Our experience of Christ goes up when we care about His experience. So while you can know He's there, you can allow the Spirit of God to truly indwell in you.
