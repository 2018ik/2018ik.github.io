>"Seek first His Kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will bea dded to you"

\- Matt. 6:33

## Background


The kingdom of God is a realm in which God can exercise his authority. The kingdom life is not just something in the future. We can enter into the kingdom life today, and the prerequisite is our growth in life.

## Matthew

Matthew is the gospel of the kingdom, and reveals many aspects of the kingdom. Those who are of the kingdom must have righteousness which surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees (Matt. 5:20). They must also do the will of the Father (Matt. 7:21). They also must be poor in spirit (Matt. 5:3), and are inevitably persecuted (Matt. 5:10).



## Kingdom Rule

The kingdom living implies a rule under the King.
