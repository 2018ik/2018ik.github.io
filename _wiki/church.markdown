## Background

The church has universal and local aspects. In Revelation, we see the universal church expressed locally in seven churches. The reality is the Body of Christ, but the manifestation of the Body requires the local churches. 

For example, a carpenter can build a chair, and design the concept with its color, material and style. If they are asked to show us the chair, they need a physical chair that is built - a practical expression of the chair. This is the local church. By seeing the physical chair, the carpenter's design is expressed. This is the expression of the universal church.

## Etymology

The Greek word for church *ekklesia* means a called out assembly. The church is therefore a congregation of people, not a physical building. 

## History

The universal church was formed after Jesus passed through His human living and became the life-giving Spirit which was breathed and poured out upon the disciples. Afterwards throughout the book of Acts, the disciples continued to establish local churches in various cities as seen in Acts and the epistles.

## Universal

The Lord Jesus mentions the church twice - once in the universal aspect and once in the local aspect.

In Matthew 16:18, when He says He will build the Church upon this rock, it refers to the universal church. On the other hand, in Matthew 18:17 when He says to bring your problems to the church, it refers to the local church, as we cannot bring problems directly to the universal church (like how we cannot practically sit on the design of a chair).

The universal church is formed, which is to produce something. When the Lord breathed Himself into the disciples in John 20 and poured Himself out as the economical Spirit in Acts 2, the universal church was formed. 

## Local

A local church is the universal church expressed locally in a particular city - for example Antioch (Acts 13:1). The Bible reveals that there is one church per city; this is the practical way in which the Body of Christ can be expressed.

While the universal church was formed by God, local churches are established by His workers. Each one of the Lord's believers have the right to got to the uttermost parts of the earth to establish churches.
