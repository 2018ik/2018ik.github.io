## Background

The church has universal and local aspects. In Revelation, we see the universal church expressed locally in seven churches. The reality is the Body of Christ, but the manifestation of the Body requires the local churches. 

For example, a carpenter can build a chair, and design the concept with its color, material and style. If we ask them to show us the chair, they need a physical chair that is built - a practical expression of the chair. This is the local church. By seeing the physical chair, we can see the expression of the carpenter's design, which would be universal church in this analogy.

## Universal

The Lord Jesus mentions the church twice - once in the universal aspect and once in the local aspect.

In Matthew 16:18, when He says He will build the Church upon this rock, it refers to the universal church. On the other hand, in Matthew  18:17 when He says to bring your problems to the church, it refers to the local church, as we cannot bring problems directly to the universal church (like how we cannot practically sit on the design of a chair).

## Local

A local church is the Body expressed locally in a particular city - for example Antioch (Acts 13:1). The Bible reveals that there is one church per city; this is the practical way in which the Body of Christ can be expressed.

### History

Jerusalem was the center of the Jewish religion, and the church there was primarily composed of Jews. On the other hand, Antioch was the center of the gentile world. Antioch was chosen by the Lord to carry out this new move to the gentiles. 

The group of believers in Antioch was quite diverse: Jews, Romans, those of African descent, those related Herod, etc. The Church is composed of all kinds of people in all kinds of backgrounds. We are different in the old creation, one one in Christ.

### Three Elements

Suppose a church is very rowdy, disorderly, divisive and sued each other constantly - is it a local church? Well, this describes the church in Corinth, which is nonetheless a local church. What constitutes a local church are the following three elements.

#### Ground of Locality

The Bible reveals that there should be one church in one city.

#### Oneness of the Body

A genuine local church must be in the fellowship of the body, and receive all the believers in the city.

#### Reality of the Spirit of Oneness
