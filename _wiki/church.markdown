## Background

The church has universal and local aspects. In Revelation, we see the universal church expressed locally in seven churches. The reality is the Body of Christ, but the manifestation of the Body requires the local churches. 

For example, a carpenter can build a chair, and design the concept with its color, material and style. If we ask them to show us the chair, they need a physical chair that is built - a practical expression of the chair. This is the local church. By seeing the physical chair, we can see the expression of the carpenter's design, which would be universal church in this analogy.

## Universal

The Lord Jesus mentions the church twice - once in the universal aspect and once in the local aspect.

In Matthew 16:18, when He says He will build the Church upon this rock, it refers to the universal church. On the other hand, in Matthew  18:17 when He says to bring your problems to the church, it refers to the local church, as we cannot bring problems directly to the universal church (like how we cannot practically sit on the design of a chair).

## Local

A local church is the Body expressed locally in a particular city - for example Antioch (Acts 13:1). The Bible reveals that there is one church per city; this is the practical way in which the Body of Christ can be expressed.

### History

Jerusalem was the center of the Jewish religion, and the church there was primarily composed of Jews. On the other hand, Antioch was the center of the gentile world. Antioch was chosen by the Lord to carry out this new move to the gentiles. 

The group of believers in Antioch was quite diverse: Jews, Romans, those of African descent, those related Herod, etc. The Church is composed of all kinds of people in all kinds of backgrounds. We are different in the old creation, one one in Christ.

### Three Elements

Suppose a church is very rowdy, disorderly, divisive and sued each other constantly - is it a local church? Well, this describes the church in Corinth, which is nonetheless a local church. What constitutes a local church are the following three elements.

#### Ground of Locality

The Bible reveals that there should be one church in one city.

#### Oneness of the Body

A genuine local church must be in the fellowship of the body, and receive all the believers in the city.

### Function

#### Administration

Matthew 18:17 says "But if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church." The church here is the local church, and must administrate over this situation.

##### Kingdom Authority

In verse 18 the Lord Jesus says, "Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on the earth shall be what has been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall be what has been loosed in heaven." Here to bind means to condemn, and to loose means to forgive. As in 16:19, what we bind or loose on earth should be what has been bound or loosed already in heaven.

The kingdom authority can be exercised by the church to deal with the offending brother. The brother mentioned in 18:15-17 is first offending and then rebellious. First he offends someone. Then because he will not listen to the one he has offended, to two or three witnesses, or even to the church, he becomes rebellious. Because he rebels against the church, the church must exercise its authority to bind and loose. It binds when such a brother is rebellious and looses when he repents. But when he repents, the church must exercise the kingdom authority to forgive him and restore him to the fellowship of the church. 

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

> So how does a local church have the authority to administrate over its members? In both Matthew 16:18 and 18:18, we see that whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven, where bind means to condemn, and loose means to forgive. Both of these were said in the context of the church, which universally is the kingdom of God on earth today.
>
>Therefore, the local church, as the practical expression of the universal church, has the authority to exercise this kingdom authority on those who rebel. So when one offends, and would not listen to the church, the church must exercise this kingdom authority to bind the brother, that is to condemn and to cut him off from fellowship. However, if he repents, the church can then forgive him and restore him to the fellowship. 
>
> It is this simple - there is no drama, no politics, no backstabbing - the church exercises its kingdom authority according to the revelation of this word to bind and to loose what has been bound and loosed in the heavens. This is neither an individual matter, nor something of man. It is the authority given to the church, and it is the authority to bind and loose what has already been accomplished in the heavens. This is to take Christ as the head.
