## Background

The fullness of the Godhead refers to the expression of the riches of the Godhead, that is the complete God of the Father, Son and Spirit.

Christ is the intrinsic constituent of the Body of Christ, and is also the embodiment of the processed Triune God (Col. 2:9) with His unsearchable riches (Eph. 3:8). The fullness in Colossians 2:9 refers not to the riches of God but to the expression of the riches of God. Expressing the riches implies the content, therefore Christ contains both the riches of the Godhead as well as its expression.

## Significance

This fullness dwells in Christ's human body (Col. 2:9). Before incarnation, the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Him indeed as the eternal Word, but not *bodily*. Only after incarnation did the fullness of the Godhead began to dwell in a bodily way. This is to produce His many children who can likewise express this fullness through the Body of Christ.

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>Colossians 2:9 says that in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. We have four key words here: dwells, fullness, Godhead and bodily. In Him *dwells* shows that everything which we are to talk about later is embodied in Christ. All the *fullness* refers to the expression and the *Godhead* refers to the complete God, including the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Lastly, bodily modifies dwells to shows that this dwelling takes place in Christ's humanity. Before incarnation, the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Him indeed as the eternal Word, but not *bodily*. Only after incarnation did the fullness of the Godhead began to dwell in a bodily way.

>The fullness of the Godhead is the expression of all the unsearchable riches of God. This is all that He is to us: God, Father, Son, Spirit, Apostle, Shepherd, Forerunner, love, patience, forgiveness, and every positive thing in the universe.
However fullness defined as expression is with respect to the Godhead; now the fullness embodied in Christ is the unsearchable riches. The unsearchable riches of Christ are the fullness of the Godhead.

>We experience this through the dispensing of Christ into the believers. On Christâ€™s side it is a matter of dispensing; on our side it is a matter of experience and enjoyment. By absorbing the riches of Christ we become the Body of Christ as the fullness of the Godhead to express Him.
