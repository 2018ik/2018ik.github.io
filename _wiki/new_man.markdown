## Background

The **new man** is humanity uplifted into divinity as the new creation, and first of whom was Christ Jesus. Every regenerated believer possesses two natures: the one that is old and the one that is new. The new man was created by the mingling of God's life with redeemed humanity, and has no connection have the old man, God's creation with the satanic life and nature.

Putting on the new man is therefore to put on Christ, who is the new man. This is to put off the old manner of life, being renewed in the spirit of the mind, that they may put on Christ (Eph 4:22-24). The new man was brought forth through death and resurrection, but needs to be completed in the believer's experiences. In order for this to take place, we must take Christ as our life and person. The new man requires the organic union with Christ, as there is no place for our natural person our opinions (Gal 6). We live not for the manifestation of our own spirituality, but for the manifestation of the one new man. 

## One New Man

In the universe, there is also a corporate new man as *one* new man which is an aspect of the church. The totality of believers having Christ's life and person becomes in God's eyes, a single entity (Eph. 2:15).
