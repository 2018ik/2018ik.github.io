## Background

The **new man** is humanity uplifted into divinity as the new creation, the totality of which is the very person of Christ. Every regenerated believer possesses two natures: the one that is old and the one that is new. The new man was created by the mingling of God's life with the totality of redeemed humanity, and has no connection to the old man, God's creation with the satanic life and nature. Therefore, the new man is to be put on by the believers (Eph. 4:24; Col. 3:10). The Bible does not speak of multiple new men, but one new man (Eph. 2:15). This corporate new man is one of the [many statuses of the church](../church#aspects).


## Creation

According to Ephesians 2:15, the one new man was created by "abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances." This is Christ's work on the cross. Christ terminated the old man on the cross, not only for Himself but for all the believers in the world (Rom. 6:6). Furthermore, the one new man was created by Christ in Himself. We are originally created in the old man Adam, but we have been re-created in the new creation in the one new man who is Christ.

## One New Man

In the universe, there is a corporate new man as *one* new man which is an aspect of the church. The totality of believers having Christ's life and person becomes in God's eyes, a single entity (Eph. 2:15). While the church as the Body of Christ implies that the church has one life with Christ, the one new man further implies that the church is one person with Christ. After all, Christ is both the Head and the Body.

## Putting on

Putting on the new man is to put on Christ who is the new man. This is to put off the old manner of life, being renewed in the spirit of the mind, that they may put on Christ (Eph 4:22-24). The new man was brought forth through death and resurrection, but needs to be completed in the believer's experiences. In order for this to take place, we must take Christ as our life and person. The new man requires the organic union with Christ, as there is no place for our natural person our opinions (Gal 6). We live not for the manifestation of our own spirituality, but for the manifestation of the one new man.
