## Background

The **new man** as *one* new man is an aspect of the church, signifying the totality of believers having Christ's life and person (Eph. 2:15). Putting on the new man as an individual is to put on Christ, who is the new man. This is to put off the old manner of life, being renewed in the spirit of the mind, that they may put on Christ(Eph 4:22-24). The new man was brought forth through death and resurrection, but needs to be completed in the believer's experiences. In order for this to take place, we must take Christ as our life and person.

The new man requires the organic union with Christ, as there is no place for our natural person our opinions (Gal 6). We live not for the manifestation of our own spirituality, but for the manifestation of the one new man.
