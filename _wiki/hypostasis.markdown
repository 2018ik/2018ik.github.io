## Background

**Hypostasis** or the plural **hypostases** is used to refer to the three of the Trinity - Father, Son and Spirit. This word has no particular semantic significance, and it was for this reason that it is the safest word to use when describing the three of the Trinity, as it comes with no conceptual baggage. The anglicized version of this word is *substance*. Thus, it can be said that God is three in substance.

Compare this to *person* from the Latin *personae* which also is also frequently used to refer the aspect of three-ness. *Personae* denotes actors who play different roles in a play, as well as family/occupational roles of a person, as well as the person himself. Thus, one may misunderstand God to be three persons according to the human concept, which can be mistakenly tritheist or modalist.

## Etymology

**Hypostasis** is the transliterated Greek word meaning "underlying support or substance" composed of *hypo* meaning under and *stasis* meaning standing. In Paul's epistles this word is rendered as "confidence" or "assurance" (2 Cor. 9:3; Heb. 3:14). This word is cognate with the Latin *substantia* which is what is used to describe the one divine essence. To alleviate the confusion, the two terms were arbitrarily assigned their common definitions despite originating from the same word.
