## Background

**Hypostasis** or the plural **hypostases** is used to refer to the three of the Trinity - Father, Son and Spirit. Alternatively, *person* has also been used instead of hypostasis to refer to a distinct hypostasis of the Trinity (though this term is inadequate as when pressed to far three Persons can lead to tritheism).

## Etymology

**Hypostasis** is the transliterated Greek word meaning "underlying support or substance" composed of *hypo* meaning under and *stasis* meaning standing. This word is cognate with the Latin *substantia* which is what is used to describe the one divine essence. To alleviate the confusion, the two terms were arbitrarily assigned their common definitions despite originating from the same word.
