## Background

**Sin** 

Sin has both a penalty and a power. When the Lord forgave the sinful woman, He dealt with the penalty of sin. When He told her to go and sin no more, He dealt with the power of sin.

## Penalty 

## Power

The power of sin is its ability to reign in one's body and the lord it over one's body (Rom. 6:12, 14). Without Christ, all are slaves under sin (Rom 6:16-20). Only the operating of the living Spirit can overcome the power of sin. We need the cleansing blood to save us from the penalty of sin, but that is just initial. We need to experience Christ as the Spirit with our spirit to save us from the power of sin.

## Willful Sin

Willful sin is to choose to do something that is contrary to God's economy. This is the sin with the definite article in Hebrews 12:1.
