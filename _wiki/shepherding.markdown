## Background

**Shepherding** is to render all-inclusive tender care to the flock. For regenerated believers, shepherding is the nourishment of Godâ€™s life in order that the flock may grow and have their existence in the divine life, thus manifesting the function of the divine life in them. For unbelievers, shepherding is to lead people to the into the the flock that they may be saved (Luke 15:3-7).

Peter charged the elders to shepherd according to God (1 Pet. 5:1-3). According to God means that this shepherding is out of God's life, nature and expression. In order to shepherd not out of natural disposition but according to God, one needs to take the cross and shepherd through the life of God which is in them. Although shepherding comes with teaching (Eph. 4:11), it is beyond good teachings of morality, ethics or Christian doctrine, but a spontaneous imparting of life from one to another. For example, telling someone they need to exercise their spirit is one thing, bringing them into their spirit by expressing God is another. In fact, genuine shepherding doesn't require saying much, and is closely related to cherishing.

## Biblical Examples

### David

David was literally a good shepherd, taking care of the sheep and fighting with lions and bears to protect them.

### Jesus

God entered into humanity in order to shepherd His people. 

John 21 is a real conclusion of all four gospels. The Lord having passed through death and resurrection, meaning that He is now the Spirit, continues to shepherd the disciples. As the 7 disciples backslid, the Lord asked proper questions to cherish them in their endeavor, actually helping them catch the fish. He did not rebuke, adjust, or correct them. This eventually led Him to commissioning Peter to feed his lambs and shepherd His sheep in His absence.

However, even in His physical absence, He is shepherding from the heavens as the Shepherd and Overseer of our souls (1 Pet. 2:25). The fact that the Lord shepherds the soul and not the spirit means that he takes care of the mind, emotion and will.

### Paul

Paul shepherded the 276 passengers of the ship during the storm to such an extent that they all became cheerful (Acts 27:36). He did not preach anything, but magnified the Lord. By enjoying the Lord, and maintaining his own joy, he shepherded the crew greatly. Both the Gospels and Acts ended not with doctrine, but shepherding in low situations. 

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

> In Hong Kong, by the time I got to my apartment it was 11 pm, and the brother who gave me a ride requested that I help him with a difficult he was going through. I was really tired and ready to sleep, but nonetheless I asked him to go ahead and speak. I tried to stay awake just so he thinks I'm very interested. Well I'm interested but I'm so tired. You know after he told everything to me, I didn't need to advise him of anything, he felt like he was shepherded. Years later he still remembered, he said "I know you went to sleep, but just for you to sleep there and let me talk really shepherded me." Can you imagine that?
