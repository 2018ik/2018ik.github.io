## Background

**The ground of the church** refers to the ground of locality (see: local church). The only way to maintain oneness within the Body of Christ is to stand on the proper ground, which is revealed in the Bible to be city in which the church is located.

## Significance

The unique, proper ground of the church being the locality where the church is saves the church from division.

## Biblical Basis

In the Old Testament, Jerusalem was the ground of the temple. If the children of Israel had built the temple anywhere else than Jerusalem, it would be on the wrong ground, even though it is the same temple. God's sovereignty was always to bring the children of Israel back to Jerusalem, even when they were in captivity in Babylon, and doing fairly well there (see: Daniel). 

In the church in Corinth, some believers liked Apollos, some liked Paul, some liked Peter, and some were even of Christ (1 Cor. 1:12). All of these churches would claim they are of Christ, with Christ as their proper foundation (1 Cor. 3:11). However, they all stood on different grounds, and were thus divided. Only Corinth is the right ground, so there must only be a single church in Corinth.
