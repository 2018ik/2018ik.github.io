## Background

In the wilderness, Jesus was tempted for forty days as a man. He overcame these temptations as a man by not exercising His divine standing and authority.

Satan's tempting of Jesus was threefold: firstly to tempt Him to ignore His human status, secondly to tempt Him to assume His divine status, and thirdly to tempt His humanity by offering the glory of the kingdoms of the world.

## Temptations

### Stones to Bread

Satan knew Jesus was hungry, and asked Jesus as the Son of God to speak to stones that they may become loaves of bread (Matt. 4:3). This would be to ignore His standing as a man and to assume His standing as a Son of God. 

He defeated the enemy through the word: "Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God" (Matt. 4:4). While Satan referred to Him as "Son of God," Jesus referred to Himself as "man" and remained in His standing as a man.

In application, when an elder or serving one gives a message, what is their base? Are they speaking so they can declare they are a real son of God? The thought and temptation to elevate oneself, regardless of the context, is to fall to this particular temptation of Satan. They must see that what they have is not worth anything to God except death and burial.


### Angelic Protection

Then, Satan brought Jesus to the wing of the temple, and asked Him once again as the Son of God, to cast Himself down and to allow His angels to bear Him up (Matt. 4:6). This is to entice Jesus to exercise His authority as the Son of God. However, He stood on His ground as a man once more by saying "You shall not test the Lord your God" (Matt. 4:7). This is to assume the position of a man, as Jesus as a man could not test His Lord.

### Worldly Glory

Now that Jesus has shown that He stood as a man, Satan tempted Him with worldly glory. If He would bow down and worship Satan, he would give Him all the kingdoms of the world (Matt. 4:8-9). 

Everyone is susceptible to considering how successful those in the world are. In comparison, laboring for the Lord does not result in material gain.

## Prayer

Although He spent forty days in the wilderness fasting, there is no record of Him praying. Although there is no record, He was likely praying (1 Thes. 5:17). This accompanying prayer was kept secret as a mystery, indicating that it was a divine and mystical prayer.
