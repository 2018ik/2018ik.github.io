## Background

The Bible begins with the tree of life in the Garden of Eden (Gen 2:??) and ends with the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in Revelation (Rev 21:??). 

## Eat the Tree

Eating the tree of life as our enjoyment should be the primary matter in our church life. The content of the church life depends on the enjoyment of Christ; all our problem are caused by the shortage of the enjoyment of Christ.

When we eat the tree of life, we eat the crucified and resurrected Christ (tree in Rev. 2:7 is the same as tree in 1 Peter 2:24 referring to the cross). Through this we experience the killing of the cross in the manifestation of the resurrection life.
