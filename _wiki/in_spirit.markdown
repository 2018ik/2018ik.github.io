## Background

To be **in spirit** is to be in the mingled spirit as a result of the exercise of the spirit. We should not analyze or convince ourselves and others that we are "in spirit." No one is in spirit by feeling; we are in spirit by faith (Eph. 3:17). It is difficult to know if a person is in Spirit - even Paul was not certain (1 Cor. 7:40). However, it is easy to tell when we are not in the spirit, such as when we lose our temper.
