## Background

**Natural ability** refers to one's capability in themselves apart from the life of Christ. This implication is that this life is good, but it is useless for God's work unless it passes through death and resurrection. For example, someone can apparently love their husband or wife out of their natural life, or out of the divine life. The the latter cannot be hurt by the enemy and overcomes death (John 11:25)..

## Biblical Basis

## Characteristics

Natural ability is:
1. Selfish, and all its schemes and devices are for the sake of self
2. Mingled with the elements of flesh and temper; therefore, when it is disapproved, it becomes provoked
3. Crafty and maneuvering
4. Proud and makes oneself feel capable, thereby resulting in boasting and self-glorification
5. Not under the control of the Holy Spirit and is extremely daring in doing anything
6. Ignorant of the will of God; it acts entirely according to self-will
7. Independent of God and does not have to rely on God but relies wholly upon self 

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

TODO

> Our dear brother Watchman Nee was extremely intelligent and everything he read he remembered and so I was in a meeting with several brothers and theer was an older brother an elder in LA and he was very closely related humanly and spiritually and he said we're gonna test you, and he gave him so newspapers. And he's reading pretty normally, taking it all in. And they could question him, and he remembered everything. That is ia God-created capacity. But he is an example of a God-created person with an extraordinary ability which is however poisoned and the self is in the cener of that, but passed through dead to be in resurrection so that the Triune God can use for His move on earth this God-created fallen regenerated human being. All of us have the natural aspect and today I just saw a newborn baby less than a week old. Someone was carrying around this little girl. Well, she's born as a human being, she's not born with divine life and nature. And so the natural life has to grow and develop, but eventually if we are pursuing the Lord, the time will come when the cross is applied to the natural life. To be in resurrection means that our natural life is crucified and that the Gold-created part ouf ur being is uplifted in resurrection to be one with Christ in resurrection. This is what happened to Watchman Nee.
