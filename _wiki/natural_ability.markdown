## Background

Natural ability is good, but useless for God's work, unless it passes through death and resurrection. 

## Biblical Basis

## Characteristics

Natural ability is:
1. Selfish, and all its schemes and devices are for the sake of self
2. Mingled with the elements of flesh and temper; therefore, when it is disapproved, it becomes provoked
3. Crafty and maneuvering
4. Proud and makes oneself feel capable, thereby resulting in boasting and self-glorification
5. Not under the control of the Holy Spirit and is extremely daring in doing anything
6. Ignorant of the will of God; it acts entirely according to self-will
7. Independent of God and does not have to rely on God but relies wholly upon self
