## Background

**Self-beautification** is to beautify for the sake of expressing man, and leads to idolatry (Exo. 32:1-4; 33:5-6). God is the Christian's beauty (Isa. 60:19), and He is beautifying the church with His life (Eph. 5:26-27). 

## Examples

### Images

Pictures of Jesus are actually idols. Not only are they plainly inaccurate, as per the description of Jesus in Isaiah 53, but the image becomes a replacement for the indwelling God.
