## Background

**God's economy**, or His plan to carry out His purpose, is His becoming man to make man God in life and nature but not in the Godhead. Man is made God, or "deified" by the dispensing of the Triune God into them to be their life and everything that they might be regenerated and transformed into the proper material for the building up of the Body of Christ that God may have a corporate expression on earth in many localities in this age with a view to the building up of the coming New Jerusalem for His eternal expression.

If we truly see God's economy, we become burdened by it. It changes, governs, limits and controls the way we think and act, both in matters of the church and our daily life.

## Etymology

The Greek word for economy is composed of two words which when combined mean "household law" or "household administration."

1. *oikos* = "house" or "home"
2. *nomos* = "law"

This is commonly translated as "stewardship" or "dispensation" (Eph. 1:10, 3:9; 1 Tim. 1:4).
Just like how a household administration comprises of a plan to distribute resources throughout the household, God's economy consists of a plan to dispense Himself into His chosen people so that He might have a household to express Himself.

The Recovery Version renders *oikonomos* as economy with respect to God, and stewardship with respect to man. God's has the plan, which when commissioned for His people to carry out is their stewardship. 

## Mystery

God's economy is a mystery, which needs to be made known to us (Eph. 1:9). Seeing God's economy requires a spirit of wisdom and revelation, and cannot be comprehended solely with human logic. It's actually the glory of God to hide His economy (Proverbs 25:2). 

## Steps

God went through a process (production) so He could be distributed and consumed.

### Becoming Man

### Dispensing

First, God dispenses Himself by means of the divine trinity. The source is the Father, the course is through the Son, and the instrument and sphere is the Spirit. That is, the dispensing is *of* the Father, *through* the Son and *in* the Spirit.

### Mingling

This is where we digest what we receive.

### Expression

#### The Church

The dispensing of God into man produces the church, the kingdom of god (1 Cor. 4:17, 20). 

#### New Jerusalem

The church as the Body of Christ consummates in the New Jerusalem, the bride of Christ, at the end of this age (Rev. 21:2).

## Aspects of God's Economy

### New Testament Economy

The content of God's entire New Testament economy in His complete salvation is Christ as the Son of Man cherishing us and as the Son of God nourishing us.

### Eternal economy 

God becoming man that man might become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead is the essence of the entire Bible, the "diamond in the box" of the bible, the eternal economy of God.

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>My friend ever since a young age was into studying the constitution. He would read blogs about the constitution and wanted to be a constitutional lawyer. This was his good pleasure, his will,his purpose, and he counseled to do so, but he needed a way to actually execute on this.
>
>The plan is the economy, the arrangement, the step-by-step details. In his mind, in order to be the best constitutional lawyer, he had to be a clerk in the office with the top constitutional lawyer in America who at that time was Justice Antonin Scalia of the U.S. Supreme Court.
>
>In order to get to Scalia's office, you need to be recommended by a lower office. In order to get to that lower level judge, you would have to be recommended by a professor that such a judge lies. In order to get that professor to like you, you would need to go to the law school in which the professor teaches, and be the top student. This is one person's human economy - and by the way he did all of that. He went to law school, worked as a research assistant for that professor, got recommended, did well in the lower office, and was finally recommended to work in Scalia's office.
>
>This is how someone with a good pleasure, with a will, with a counsel, still needed a plan i.e. an economy to carry this out.
