## Background

The children's work or children's service encompasses all services which deal with raising up the children, generally those of elementary school age. This includes holding meetings, both during Lord's day as well as throughout the week which are focused on shepherding the children, as well as contacting the children's parents or preparing teaching material.

## Importance

Nurturing the next generation must begin at a young age. While the parents play the primary role, that does not mean the church should ignore this responsibility and to make up for what the parents lack. The key difference between the church's children's work and parenting however is that the former allows friendships to be established between children and families. 

## History

The children's work was initially just a child-care service, where parents who attend the meeting can leave their children. This was because the children won't easily understand what is going on in the adult's meeting, and can also be a distraction. Furthermore, they could develop the impression that the meetings are not interesting, and be reluctant to attend when they grow up. Therefore, the children's work began. Properly prepared material followed, such as videos and songs. Then, there was a burden to have children meetings not just as the Lord's day meeting daycare but also to continue to foster the children throughout the week.

## Services

### Meetings

There should be a children's meeting held alongside every Lord's day meeting for parents who bring their children. However, to use this space for the gathering of potentially thousands of children in a city is not scalable. Therefore, the best location is in the saint's homes. If a hundred couples have an average of two children, and each family opened their home for a children's meeting for ten, there will be an extra eight hundred spots for other children in the community. These parents do not need to worry about providing the learning material as the church can handle such matters.

### Preparing Material

Videos, songs, stories and other learning material should be developed as children do not like listening to long messages and sermons. This should be an interactive experience. 

### Contacting Parents

The gospel can be spread through the children's meetings. If children from the neighborhood are invited, it presents an opportunity to contact the parents.
