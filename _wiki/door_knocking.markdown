## Background

Door-knocking is one of the gospel-preaching practices in the God-ordained way, based on the New Testament example of teaching from house to house (Acts 2:46; 5:42; 20:20).

## Biblical Basis

In Acts, we see that the apostles taught from house to house - "And every day, in the tempel and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and announcing the gospel of Jesus as the Christ" (Acts 5:42).
