## Background

**Alexander the coppersmith** was a person who did many evil things to Paul (2 Tim. 4:14). 

## Significance

As someone listed by name in Paul's epistle, Alexander was likely a brother in the Lord. To fall into doing many evil things shows that he lacked the proper humanity of a Christian. This was because he lost the safeguard of loving the Lord. When one truly loves the Lord, they spontaneously love all the fellow members of the Body.
