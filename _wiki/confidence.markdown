## Background

**Confidence** causes a person to be closed to God. Shortcomings and defeats actually work *for* believers in order to lead them to God. All things work together for good to those who love God (Rom. 8:28). Apparently in human opinions, certain sufferings are purely setbacks, but in God's view, these are for the constitution of God into man, that his strong "hip" may be touched (Gen. 32:25).
