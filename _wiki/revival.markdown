in the midst of the years."

Among God's elect there is an aspiration to be revived. As saved ones, we should have the spontaneous prayer to be revived. 

## Significance


### Revival

The Lord needs to revive us (Hab. 3:2) so that we can enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is (Eph. 3:9). This has been revealed to us, and now we need to have the burden to enlighten all; it is not merely an individual matter.Revival is not just a one time thing, or a once a year thing. We need to be revived every morning during morning revival.

## Habakkuk's Prayer

Although this prayer was a long time ago and has nothing to do with us, it is nonetheless significant as with God their is no time element. We likewise must pray for such a revival, and when looking at the state of Christianity today, you can see that such as revival is necessary.
