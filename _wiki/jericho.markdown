## Background

## Significance

Sometimes when we speak the word of God to someone, there seems to be no response. That sinner is a fortified city, a Jericho. We may need to continue to silently "walk around" that sinner and just pray. We may be with them and not talk about anything spiritual in nature. We simply take care of them as a relative, friend, new gospel contact. But inwardly, we are praying and marching around this fortified city. As we are praying, the spirit is operating. At a certain point, we receive the Lord's word and we speak as the children of Israel blew the trumpet. When you do this, the walls come tumbling down and you possess that sinner for Christ. As you were praying, shepherding, spending time, the Spirit is sweeping and the lamp gets lit up and the word which you spoke to them begin to operate in them. The Spirit is sweeping *until* she finds.
