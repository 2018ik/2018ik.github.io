## Background

The **discipline of the Holy Spirit** refers to God's working in and on his people through trials and chastisement for outer man to be broken that the inner man can be released.

## Biblical Basis

God disciplines those whom he loves in order that they may partake of His holiness (Heb. 12:5-9). When a person is not disciplined, they retain their natural taste and scent rather than the fragrance of Christ (Jer. 48:11; 2 Cor. 2:14-15)

## Significance
