## Background

The Triune God is a God of **hope**. 

## Significance

The world is actually hopeless, regardless of how the world leaders and politicians attempt to piece the world together. The real hope is in God Himself, as the God of hope. This God of hope fills His people with all joy and peace (Rom. 15:13).
