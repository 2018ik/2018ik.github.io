## Background

The **mystery of Christ** in Ephesians 3:4 refers to the church, the Body of Christ. After seeing the mystery of God, which is Christ, one must continue on to see the church. The church comes out of Christ; without Christ there is no church. This is why these two mysteries (of God, of Christ) are in series. These mysteries are what the Lord is recovering on earth today: Christ and the church.

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>There's a husband and wife we would have a home meeting with. The wife was at home with the kids and she turned on the radio and ended up tuning to the Life Study radio broadcast and she was just attracted to the ministering of Christ. She thought to herself, "I can't wait until my husband gets home so I can share these things with them." Meanwhile, her husband was at work and during his lunch break he turned on his radio and tuned to the same radio program, and he thought the same thing. So when he came home they met each other at the door, they both said "I got something to tell you." And they discovered it was the same thing. The subjective Christ ministered in the radio broadcast was so attractive to them. Only after seeing Christ did they enter into the church life.

### Testimony #2

>In London, there was an older couple about grandparent age. They were really dear believers for decades: loved the lord, given  to the lord, and according to what they saw they were faithful at the place they were meeting. So they would come to meet with us and we would do these seminars during the weekends and they were loving it, just loving the riches. We were raising up more districts of the church and again the brothers were very clear - don't go out and tell these ones, "now you must come to meet with us." Never speak like this. When you're starting a new district, you're temped - "we got a new district why don't you come?" We didn't do that, we just kept enjoying the Lord and ministering Christ to them. And one by one, they began to leave their denominations without us telling them to and began to meet with the church in London. And this couple shared their experience. The wife went said, "Yea we would go back to our denomination and we would share with the ones there what we enjoyed of Christ and while we would share to them and they would just stare at us and say nothing. Eventually the pastor would come up and say please don't talk about these things here. So I told my husband, 'I'm done coming here. I just want to go meet with them because at least we can enjoy Christ and share about Christ' and he had the same feeling." But that wasn't us, that was the Christ in them. We have to see this, first Christ, then the church. The church always must be the issue of Christ, something coming out of Christ.

### Testimony #3

>So we see that the wise God has wisely arranged all the requirements for us to enter into the mystery of Christ, which is the church. First He is the Triune God. Then, in John 5:43 we see that Son came in the name of the Father. Then, in John 14:26, we see the Spirit came in the name of the Son. When we have the Spirit, we have the Son, we have the Father, we have the Triune God! 
> 
> This Spirit which will teach us all things, and to guide us into all reality, and we see in 1 Corinthians chapter 2 that this is the Spirit which searches and makes known to us the depths of God. This is also a spirit of wisdom and revelation. To see this mystery, we need this wisdom, but our brains are too small to see this mystery on our own. We have to exercise our spirit!
>
> We also must have the eyes of heart enlightened, which consists of a pure conscience, a sober mind, a loving emotion and a submissive will. We must also know that God is surpassingly great and powerful, and this power is transmitted to us like electricity. 
>
>Christ is very powerful, and and has a fourfold resurrecting, transcending, subjecting and heading up power. By heading up all things in Christ, all that He is is transmitted to us, which builds up church. When we see this mystery, we receive the heavenly transmission, which builds the church, which becomes the Body of Christ.
