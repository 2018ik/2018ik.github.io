## Background

The mystery of Christ in Ephesians 3:4 refers to the church, the Body of Christ. In order to see this mystery, 

## Testimony

### Testimony #1

>So we see firstly that the prerequisite for our seeing of the mystery of Christ, which is the church, is the Triune God. In John 5:43, we see that the Son came in the name of the Father. Then, in John 14:26, we see the Spirit comes in the name of the Son. This means the Son comes as the Father and the Spirit comes as the Son, which means when the Spirit comes, there is the Son, and when the Son comes, there is the Father. All three of the Triune God come with the Spirit. 
>
> We also see this in Ephesians 1:17, where the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of Glory gives us a spirit of wisdom and revelation. So the means by which this mystery is revealed to us is through the Spirit.
> 
> This is the Spirit which will teach us all things, and to guide us into all reality, and we see in 1 Corinthians chapter 2 that this is the Spirit which searches and makes known to us the depths of God. We must exercise our spirit for this mystery to be revealed to us.
>
> We also must have the eyes of heart enlightened, which consists of a pure conscience, a sober mind, a loving emotion and a submissive will.
> 
> The issuing of seeing this mystery is that it is the foundation upon which the Church is built. While the Church is built on Christ as the rock, in Ephesians 2:20 we see it is also build upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets. These are those who have had the mystery of Christ revealed to them. Actually, Christ is very powerful, and and has a fourfold resurrecting, transcending, subjecting and heading up power. By heading up all things in Christ, all that He is is transmitted to us, which builds up church, which becomes the Body of Christ.
