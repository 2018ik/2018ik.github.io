## Significance

Multiplying one's talents, that is, to bear fruit (John 15:16) is not a burden which God imposes on a select few. Actually every believer has at least one talent, and they have the divine commission to preach the gospel in order to bear fruit. Eventually, God will come to settle accounst with the believers (Matt. 25:19) where the works of each one will be made manifest (1 Cor. 3:12-13) which will determine those who are overcomers and receive the kingdom reward (1 Cor. 3:14).
