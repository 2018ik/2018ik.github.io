## Background

In the **parable of talents**, three slaves are given five, two and one talent respectively. The slaves given five and two talents duplicated their talents, while the one-talented slave buried the talent. The former two were considered good and faithful slaves, while the latter was considered evil and slothful.

## Significance

Multiplying one's talents, that is, to bear fruit (John 15:16) is not a burden which God imposes on a select few. Actually every believer has at least one talent, and they have the divine commission to function, which in this context is to preach the gospel in order to bear fruit. Eventually, God will come to settle accounts with the believers (Matt. 25:19) where the works of each one will be made manifest (1 Cor. 3:12-13) which will determine those who are overcomers and receive the kingdom reward (1 Cor. 3:14).
