## Background

**Rest** is perfect peace and satisfaction that results from coming to the Lord Jesus (Matt. 11:28). Many believers labor in a toiling manner, striving to keep the commandments of the law or to be successful in any kind of endeavor. On one hand, we need to bear certain responsibilities, but on the other hand, we must come to the Lord to receive the supply so that we are able to labor and toil. Therefore, true rest is to be set free from toiling by virtue of experiencing and enjoying Christ as perfect peace and satisfaction. True rest also issues in God's will being accomplished.
