## Background

A **crown** in the New Testament signifies a prize given in addition to salvation, something reserved for the overcoming believers.

## Righteousness

The crown of righteousness is a reward for those who have finished their course (2 Tim. 4:7-8). This is a righteousness that is not by grace but through works (Rev. 22:12; 2 Cor. 5:10). Those who receive the crown of righteousness are overcomers who will inherit the [millennial kingdom](../millennium).

## Glory

This is also a crown given to the overcomers (1 Pet. 5:4). 

## Life

The crown of life is for those who are faithful unto death (Rev. 2:10). Such ones have attained to the out-resurrection from among the dead, the outstanding resurrection (Phil. 3:10-11).

## Incorruptible

1 Cor. 9:25
