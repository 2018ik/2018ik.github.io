## Background

The **divine and mystical realm** is the realm which man enters when they are one with God. Divine is on God's side, mystical is on man's side. In the case of the first God-man Jesus, He was a man in the flesh, yet He prayed and was one with God in a divine and mystical way (John 14:20). 

## Argument

There are many concepts and veils regarding the word "spiritual" that takes away from true spirituality which is from God. Therefore, it is better to use a more accurate word: divine. True spirituality should make someone divine. For someone to do something divinely means they are also doing it spiritually. But divine directly indicates it is out from God, whereas spiritual can technically also refer to other spiritual forces, such as demons (Eph. 6:12).

The human life is made mystical. To be human and to live divinely is to be mystical. The fact that God can be expressed through a man Jesus, and through His regenerated people is a divine, and mystical fact. It cannot be understood, it is a mystery.
