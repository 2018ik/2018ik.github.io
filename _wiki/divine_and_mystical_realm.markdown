## Background

The **divine and mystical realm** (DMR) is the Triune God Himself as a coinhering realm where the Son and the Father indwell each other (John 14:10-11). This realm is not enterable except by the mingled spirit, which is why the divine and mystical realm is often qualified with "of the consummated Spirit and the pneumatic Christ" (DMRCSPC). One enters the DMR when they enter into the processed Triune God who is embodied in Christ as the life-giving Spirit in their mingled spirit. Divine is on God's side, mystical is on man's side. In the case of the first God-man Jesus, He was a man in the flesh, yet He prayed and was one with God in a divine and mystical way (John 14:20).

Objectively, one is born into the DMR through regeneration. Subjectively, one enters into this realm experientially by exercising their mingled spirit.
 
## Divine and Mystical

There are many concepts and veils regarding the word "spiritual" that takes away from true spirituality which is from God. Therefore, it is better to use a more accurate word: divine. True spirituality should make someone divine. For someone to do something divinely means they are also doing it spiritually. But divine directly indicates it is out from God, whereas spiritual can technically also refer to other spiritual forces, such as demons (Eph. 6:12).

The human life is made mystical. To be human and to live divinely is to be mystical. The fact that God can be expressed through a man Jesus, and through His regenerated people is a divine, and mystical fact. It cannot be understood, it is a mystery. 

Suppose there are two identical twins the parents of whom are from North Korea. It so worked out that one of the twins would like in the U.S. while the other would be raised in North Korea. They would meet 20 years after separating from each other; they would have similar genes so they would have similar facial features and whatnot. But because they have lived in two different realms for such a period of time, there would be an extreme difference between the two with regards to their culture, opinions, and outlook on life. 

Suppose there are two young men who were saved in 1980 during Billy Graham's gospel meeting where one entered into the Lord's Recovery and the other into a denomination. The one who spent their whole life in the denomination would live in the physical realm, content with going to Sunday service, donating, reading the Bible every once in a while. The other in the Lord's Recovery might have learned about entering into the divine and mystical realm and have lived in this marvelous realm for 30 years. When they meet again, would there not be a drastic difference between the two since they were living in different realms?

Lord show me the surpassing worth and preciousness of you as the divine and mystical realm. lord disciple me to learn how to live in you as the divine and mystical realm of the processed and consummated triune God  train me to abide in you as this wonderful realm.

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>I know a sister who lived in a really bad neighborhood in a country of a low human development index. She would see bullets fly in neighborhood. One day, she saw another kind of lifestyle: the lifestyle of north american countries like Canada and the USA. She may have seen either a documentary or movie about what its like to live in this kind of country. It generated a never-to-be-forgotten desire to migrate to those countries and live there. By the Lords's sovereign mercy it happened, she migrated to Canada received an excellent education, and now lives with her three daughters in the U.S. Once the Lord opens our eyes to see the preciousness of the divine and mystical realm we will give ourselves to dwell in Him every moment of the days of our life. You will find it so previous, marvelous and wonderful.
