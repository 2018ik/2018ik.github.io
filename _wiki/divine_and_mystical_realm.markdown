## Background

The **divine and mystical realm** is the realm which man enters when they are one with God. Divine is on God's side, mystical is on man's side. In the case of the first God-man Jesus, He was a man in the flesh, yet He prayed and was one with God in a divine and mystical way (John 14:20). 

## Explanation

There are many concepts and veils regarding the word "spiritual" that takes away from true spirituality which is from God. Therefore, it is better to use a more accurate word: divine. True spirituality should make someone divine. For someone to do something divinely means they are also doing it spiritually. But divine directly indicates it is out from God, whereas spiritual can technically also refer to other spiritual forces, such as demons (Eph. 6:12).

The human life is made mystical. To be human and to live divinely is to be mystical. The fact that God can be expressed through a man Jesus, and through His regenerated people is a divine, and mystical fact. It cannot be understood, it is a mystery. 

Suppose there are two identical twins the parents of whom are from North Korea. It so worked out that one of the twins would like in the U.S. while the other would be raised in North Korea. They would meet 20 years after separating from each other; they would have similar genes so they would have similar facial features and whatnot. But because they have lived in two different realms for such a period of time, there would be an extreme difference between the two with regards to their culture, opinions, and outlook on life. 

Suppose there are two young men who were saved in 1980 during Billy Graham's gospel meeting where one entered into the Lord's Recovery and the other into a denomination. The one who spent their whole life in the denomination would live in the physical realm, content with going to Sunday service, donating, reading the Bible every once in a while. The other in the Lord's Recovery might have learned about entering into the divine and mystical realm and have lived in this marvelous realm for 30 years. When they meet again, would there not be a drastic difference between the two since they were living in different realms?
