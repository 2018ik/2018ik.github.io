## Background

**Death** is to end life and can be a positive or negative thing, depending on whether it is satanic death or the death of Christ (Heb. 2:14). 

The ultimate issue of Satan's plot concerning man. Satan entered into man as sin, and through sin, death came as a result (Rom. 5:12). He did not want to merely dirty man with sin, but to bring him entirely into death.

By the Son of God coming as life (John 1:4; 10:10; 11:25; 1 John 5:12), death is nullified (2 Tim. 1:10) and the devil who has the might of death is destroyed (Heb. 2:14).
