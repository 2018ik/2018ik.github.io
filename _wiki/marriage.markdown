## Background

**Marriage** is for two parties to be joined as one, and is the consummation of God's entire New Testament economy (John 17:21; Rev. 21:2). God ordained marriage as an imperfect picture of the marriage between Himself and man as the New Jerusalem, a perfect divine and human incorporation that is one in life, nature an expression but not in the Godhead.

God is always seeking to recover us back to His original intention. In fact, divorce was allowed by Moses due to the hardness of man's heart, but actually, the Lord wants to recover us back to God's original intention and standard where husband and wife cannot be divorced (Matt. 19:8-9)
