## Background

**Marriage** is for two parties to be joined as one, and is the consummation of God's entire New Testament economy (John 17:21; Rev. 21:2). God ordained marriage as an imperfect picture of the marriage between Himself and man as the New Jerusalem, a perfect divine and human incorporation that is one in life, nature an expression but not in the Godhead.

## Typology

Marriage as a picture between God and man is illustrated by Paul in Ephesians 5. The husband is the head of the marriage, and the wife should be under his headship. Likewise, Christ is the Head of the Body, the church. The husband should also love his wife as Christ loved the church. 

In the age of grace as the church, the believers are betrothed to Christ. The wedding day is the age of the millennium (a thousand days can be interpreted to be a day in God's eyes). The marriage consummates in the New Jerusalem, which lasts for eternity.

## ???

God is always seeking to recover us back to His original intention. In fact, divorce was allowed by Moses due to the hardness of man's heart, but actually, the Lord wants to recover us back to God's original intention and standard where husband and wife cannot be divorced (Matt. 19:8-9)
