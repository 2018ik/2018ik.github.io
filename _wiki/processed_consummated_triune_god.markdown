## Background

The **processed and consummated Triune God** refers to God's going through of many processes (incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension) to be consummated as the life-giving Spirit, the consummated Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). The end result is that God can now enter into and be substantiated by man as the Spirit. Now, man can likewise be processed (through organic salvation) and consummated as the New Jerusalem, the bride of Christ. 

Before, God was like an orange, but now, he has been processed and consummated as juice for us to enjoy in a practical way. 

## Processes

Some may say that the eternal, unchanging God cannot possibly be processed, but this is based on a veiled and limited understanding of Scripture. Was incarnation not a process? God was incarnated, coming as the only-begotten Son of God (John 3:16). Then, he went through thirty-three and a half years of human living, followed by His crucifixion. Then, he was resurrected and glorified (Luke 24:26) which made Him the Firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29) and the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Then He ascended and was made Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36) and head over all things to the church (Eph. 1:22-23).

## Examples

God becoming man (John 1:1; 1:14) and man becoming the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) was a process so that man can take in and enjoy God. There are many real-world examples of processes which raw materials go through in order to be enjoyed by man.

### Journeying God

Economically speaking, in eternity past, God was the bachelor God. He had the species of divinity, so in order to have His bride He created man. Then, entered into humanity as the incarnated God. Then He became the redeeming God. Then in resurrection He became the bountiful Spirit of God. By this compound Spirit He is able to work His element into man that they might become the same as He is life and nature to match Him as His counterpart. In the millennial kingdom, He is the honeymoon God, and then finally in eternity future with the New Jerusalem, He is the married God. This is the bachelor God journeying across the bridge of time to become the married God.

### Orange

A whole orange cannot be swallowed by man. Thus, the orange needs to go through a process of peeling and slicing, to become the slices. 

### Steak
