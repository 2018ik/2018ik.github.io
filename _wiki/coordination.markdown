## Background

Coordination is the greatest need in the Lord's move on the Earth. Without coordination there is no move. 

The Body of Christ is not an organization. In an organization there is hierarchy to ensure things are carried out in a good way. In the Body it is not like this; it is in the way of life. We are all joined to the Lord as the head (Eph 4:12). 

The Lord is not only the corporate head, but also the individual head (Eph 4:15). 

We are not only joined to the Lord, but we are also joined to each other (Rom. 7:5). We are organically joined to the Lord and to one another - this is an organism where life is flowing.

## Application

The way of the Triune God is "Let Us" (Gen. 1:26). On the other hand, the way of Satan is "I will" (Isa. 14:12-14, Matt 4:8-9). Satan is very individualistic; he wants to be like the Most High and will attempt to do so through his own means. This is demonstrated in his attempt to tempt Jesus in Matthew 4, where he tried to get Jesus to act out of His own will rather than the Father's.

"I'm going to get it done" is not God's way. Although we may be able to do something by ourselves, we should still get someone to go with us. And with two, there is coordination required. Let us reject Satan's way and take the Triune God's way.

## Four levels of coordination

1: that of the Triune God

The Triune God Himself is the highest level of coordination. The Son is with the Father, and can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing (John 5:19). Jesus always chose to do the Father's will, and did not speak anything besides what the Father spoke.

Likewise, the Spirit is also with the Son. The Spirit does not speak from Himself, but what He hears from the Son (John 16:13).

2: the apostles with the Triune God

The apostles were forbidden by the Spirit to speak in Asia. When the Spirit stopped the apostles, they stopped. When Paul was going to Troas, he had a dream which led him to go to Macedonia instead.  

### Paul

Paul imitated Christ (1 Cor 11:1). But we should likewise imitate Paul. 

Second Corinthians reveals the coordination of Paul with the heavenly ministry of Christ. He conveyed the comfort of God (2 Cor 1:3-4), the savor of Him in every place (2 Cor 2:4), and the fragrance of Christ (2 Cor. 2:15).

He also ministered Christ through writing living letters of Christ with Christ as the content (2 Cor 3:3). 

He also beheld the glory of God, that he might then reflect this glory to others (2 Cor 3:18). 

Lastly, he reveals that the believers are earthen - or worthless - vessels which contain the Christ of glory as the excellent treasure (2 Cor 4:7).

Paul delivered only what he received as a slave of God. 

### John

John had the vision of the churches (Rev. 1:9-11), the destiny of the churches (Rev. 17:1), and the New Jerusalem (Rev 21:9-10). These visions required a coordination with God. 

### Joshua

Joshua coordinated with Jehovah to destroy Jericho. They followed the direction of Jehovah strictly to accomplish this.

### Gideon

Gideon cooperated with God to reduce the size of the army to a mere 300.
