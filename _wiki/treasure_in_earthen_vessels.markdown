## Background

The **treasure in earthen vessels** is Christ Himself as the life-giving Spirit who shines in our hearts (2 Cor. 4:6-7). Christ is a treasure because He does everything for us by His grace. When He operates in us, the excellency of the power of is manifestly of God and not out of us (2 Cor. 4:7b). Outwardly, the human shell is a worthless earthen vessel; but inwardly, there is a priceless treasure. When Christ is lived out, the worthless vessels bear the image of Christ, the expression of the Triune God. Although each believer has this treasure, whether or not they sense that they possess the treasure and live by the supply of this treasure depends on their seeing of the face of Jesus Christ (2 Cor. 4:6).

## Application

It's easy to believe that the treasure is God, and we are earthen vessels. However, we need to have the realization of this in everything that we do. The source of all dissatisfaction is self-love, that is, for one to think that they are not just an earthen vessel.
