## Background

The **treasure in earthen vessels** is Christ Himself as the life-giving Spirit who shines in our hearts (2 Cor. 4:6-7). Christ is a treasure because He does everything for us by His grace. When He operates in us, the excellency of the power of is manifestly of God and not out of us (2 Cor. 4:7b). Outwardly, the human shell is a worthless earthen vessel; but inwardly, there is a priceless treasure. However, when Christ is lived out, we bear the image of Christ, the expression of the Triune God.

Although each believer has this treasure, whether or not they sense they possess such a treasure depends on their seeing of the face of Jesus Christ (2 Cor. 4:6).
