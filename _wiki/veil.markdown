## Background

The majority of Christians today have a veiled understanding of the Bible. These veils can be removed by having a heart turned to the Lord (2 Cor. 3:16). This implies that veils are actually just a turned away, darkened heart. When a person has a heart turned to the Lord, this is a single heart, a pure heart, and a simplified heart. One must learn to drop all veils in order to see the intrinsic significance of the Bible.

## Types

### Natural Concepts

All have concepts born out of natural fallen thinking, such as ethical concepts of the discipes of Confucious. 

### Human Philosophies

Communism, pragmatism, etc.

### Christian Teachings

Christian teachings are often mistaken (e.g. believers going to heaven). They can also be sound and fundamental, yet superficial. 

### Religious Concepts

Like Paul, attempting to serve God but failing to do so because of his judaistic veil.

### National Character

### Culture

### Disposition

Lazy people will interpret the Bible based on their lazy character and disposition.

## Biblical Examples

### Mary

The apostles Peter and John were satisfied with the facts when they arrived at the Lord's tomb. They saw the tomb was in good order, the Lord must've resurrected, and they went home. On the other hand, Mary stood outside weeping and wanted to find exactly where the Lord was. Because she loved the Lord to the uttermost, she sought the Lord, and therefore she was the first to recieve the revelation that Christ was the firstborn among many brothers.
