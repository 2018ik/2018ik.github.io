## Background

A **veil** is something which separates man from God, especially in seeing biblical revelation. The source of all veils is the flesh, and veils themselves also signify the flesh. Dealing with veils, as with dealing with the flesh, requires the dealing of the cross.

The majority of Christians today have a veiled understanding of the Bible. These veils can be removed by having a heart turned to the Lord (2 Cor. 3:16). This implies that veils are actually just a turned away, darkened heart. When a person has a heart turned to the Lord, this is a single heart, a pure heart, and a simplified heart. One must learn to drop all veils in order to see the intrinsic significance of the Bible.

## Biblical Basis

The tabernacle had two veils: one at the entrance into the Holy Place, and one dividing the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies (Exo. 26:36-37; Heb. 9:3). The flesh is what prevents a Christian from contacting God in their spirit, typified by the Holy of Holies. God is calling us through the veil to enter the Holy of Holies, but in order to do this one must terminate their flesh, that is to deny their soul-life (Heb. 10:19-20). In the eyes of God, the veil was split when Christ was crucified (Matt. 27:51), but in man's experience, the veil, the flesh, continues to remain (Gal. 5:24; Rom. 8:6). 

## Types

### Natural Concepts

All have concepts born out of natural fallen thinking, such as ethical concepts of the discipes of Confucious. 

### Human Philosophies

Communism, pragmatism, etc.

### Christian Teachings

Christian teachings are often mistaken (e.g. believers going to heaven). They can also be sound and fundamental, yet superficial. 

### Religious Concepts

Like Paul, attempting to serve God but failing to do so because of his judaistic veil.

### National Character

### Culture

### Disposition

Lazy people will interpret the Bible based on their lazy character and disposition.

## Biblical Examples

### Mary

The apostles Peter and John were satisfied with the facts when they arrived at the Lord's tomb. They saw the tomb was in good order, the Lord must've resurrected, and they went home. On the other hand, Mary stood outside weeping and wanted to find exactly where the Lord was. Because she loved the Lord to the uttermost, she sought the Lord, and therefore she was the first to receive the revelation that Christ was the firstborn among many brothers.

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>2 Corinthians 3:15-16 says that a "veil lies on their hear; but whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away." There are so many persons, matters and things that our hearts are turned to besides the Lord. But thank God we don't need to exercise our mind to introspect regarding what these things are or how to deal with them, but we simply need to exercise our will to turn our heart to the Lord, and the Lord is faithful to take the veil away. He is faithful to take away our idols and broken cisterns. In the next verse we see that in this way we experience true freedom. We experience true joy - beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord!
