## Background

The book of **Ephesians** presents the highest revelation of God's economy: Christ and the church. 

## Subject

The main subject of the book of Ephesians is the church in seven aspects:

| Aspect | Description |
| --- | --- |
| The Body of Christ | The expression of Christ with a measurable stature |
| The new man | The life and person of Christ |
| The kingdom of God | Having rights and responsibilities |
| The household of God | A family with life and enjoyment |
| The dwelling place of God | For God to live in |
| The bride and wife of Christ | For Christ's rest and satisfaction |
| The warrior | To defeat the enemy to accomplish God's purpose | 

*\*For all aspects throughout the Bible, see [church](../church#aspects)*

## Topics

### Trinity

Paul structures His arguments with the Trinity in view. Ephesians 1:3 says that the Father blessed us *in Christ*. 2:18 says that we have access in on Spirit unto the Father. 3:11 says that the Father made His eternal purpose in Christ Jesus. The entire Trinity is seen in the prayer from 3:14-19. 


### Body of Christ

Ephesians 4:12-16 shows the mystery concerning the building up of the Body of Christ.

### Human Spirit

In every chapter of the book, Paul mentions the human spirit. The human spirit is a realm and when we are in the spirit, we are in eternity. In chapter 2, at the beginning we are not in eternity but dead in our sins and our offenses. When we are not in our spirit we may be disappointed at this beginning. But we should be encouraged. Despite our earthly and fallen condition, God is able to produce a masterpiece, that one new man. 

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>If you ask someone what is the meaning of the book of Ephesians, some may say according to chapter 2, by grace we are saved. Or perhaps in Ephesians 5, that wives should be subject to their husbands. To them, that is the heart of Ephesians. Some parents may love chapter 6 - children should obey their parents in all things. Children, don't vex your parents! Well, all these verses are not the basic structure of the book of Ephesians. 
>
>The intrinsic content of the book of Ephesians in the Triune God dispensed into the believers for the producing and building up of the Body of Christ. We need to pray to see the Triune God in every page of the Bible. The Bible is full of "God said," but did you realize that every time this is written, the Triune God is involved? God only speaks one kind of languages - that is the Son! Hebrews 1:2 reveals that God has spoken to us in the Son! The Spirit is also the breath of God. The Father is the speaker, the Son is the word, and the Spirit is the breath.
