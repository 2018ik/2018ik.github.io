## Background

**Manna** was a heavenly food given to the children of Israel described as "bread out of heaven" after their exodus from Egypt (Exo. 16:4). The Israelites were constituted with the Egyptian diet after eating that way for centuries, and therefore had to be reconstituted with God's element.

## Significance

Manna is a type of Christ as heavenly food for His people.

Manna is also a precursor to the all-inclusive Christ as the good land, as the first time the children of Israel ate of the produce of the good land, the manna stopped (Josh. 5:12). The days of not laboring on Christ were over; God's people had to labor to eat the produce of the land.

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

> We were riding this bus in Jerusalem, and on this bus were C.W. R.K. E.M. etc., and we were at the back. All of a sudden we look to the right and there was a Chinese restauarant, and all the brothers from Taiwan said "stop the bus!" Why did they say stop the bus? Because they were constituted with Chinese food.
