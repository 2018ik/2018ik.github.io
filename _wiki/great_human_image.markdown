## Background

The **great human image** in Daniel 2 is a prophetic illustration of the history of  human government, sovereignly arranged by the Lord for the carrying out of His economy. The four parts of the image signify four world empires:

1. Head of Gold - Babylonian Empire
2. Breast and arms of silver - Medo-Persia
3. Abdomen and thighs of bronze - Greece, including Macedonia
4. Legs of iron and feet of iron and partly of clay - Roman Empire

The stone cut without hands which crush the feet of the image is Christ with the overcomers, His bride. This stone is not individual pebbles, but a single stone, a corporate warrior.
