## Background

The **antichrist** is a person one with Satan and of great power who will rise up during the consummation of the present age (1 John 2:18).

Antichrist also more generally refers to anyone who denies the Father and the Son, that is to deny that Jesus is the Christ (1 John 2:22). There were many antichrists in the early church, such as Cerinthus who taught adoptionism in the first century.
