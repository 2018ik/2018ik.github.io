## Background

**Antichrist** can refer to three things:

1. A person one with Satan and of great power ("the Antichrist") who will rise up during the consummation of the present age (1 John 2:18). This individual will be the last Caesar of the revived Roman Empire (Rev. 17:12)
2. Anyone who denies the Father and the Son, that is to deny that Jesus is the Christ (1 John 2:22). There were many antichrists in the early church, such as Cerinthus who taught adoptionism in the first century.
3. The principle of antichrist, which is to deny what Christ is or something of His person. This is to replace Christ with various things in our lives. Christ is all-inclusive, meaning He can be included in every situation no matter who we are or what we are doing. However, there are parts of our being that we do not allow Christ to enter into, either willfully or subconsciously.
