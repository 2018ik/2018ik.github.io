### Great Human Image

The great human image in Daniel 2 is a prophetic illustration of the history of  human government, sovereignly arranged by the Lord for the carrying out of His economy. The four parts of the great human image signify four world empires:

1. Head of Gold - Babylonian Empire
2. Breast and arms of silver - Medo-Persia
3. Abdomen and thighs of bronze - Greece, including Macedonia
4. Legs of iron and feet of iron and partly of clay - Roman Empire

The stone cut without hands which crush the feet of the image is Christ with the overcomers, His bride. This stone is not individual pebbles, but a single stone, a corporate warrior.
