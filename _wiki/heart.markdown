## Background

The **heart** consists of the soul and the conscience and is the gateway to the spirit. The heart is the conglomerate of a person's inward parts. While the soul represents a person, and is commonly translated as such (i.e. X number of souls = X number of persons), a person in action and moving towards a goal is actually their heart. Furthermore, the heart is a loving organ.

Just like how healthy physical heart is needed for physical living, a healthy heart is needed for psychological and spiritual living. It is imperative to [deal with the heart](../dealing_with_heart), as the spirit only works when the heart is active; if the heart is indifferent, the spirit is imprisoned within and is unable to express its capability. God wants His people to have a heart that is soft, pure, loving and at peace.

## Significance

The heart is a loving organ (Mark 12:30). As such, one must exercise their heart to love the Lord before they do anything else. If they focus solely on their spirit, to touch the Spirit in their spirit, and forget about loving the Lord, that would be terrible. Actually, all spiritual experience begins with the heart. All believers need a simple turn to just love the Lord.

The heart is in a sense a gateway into one's being. An open heart is required for receiving God. This applies not only to initial salvation, but to all spiritual experience. The great power of the spirit is controlled by one's heart (Prov. 4:23).

## Biblical Basis

### Soul

The entire soul is contained in the heart. We can see this based on functions of the heart mentioned in the Bible.

#### Mind

Genesis 6:5 and Hebrews 4:12 reveals that the heart has thoughts, and Matthew 9:4 shows that the heart can think, indicating an aspect of the mind.

#### Emotion

John 16:22 shows the heart can rejoice, while 16:6 shows that the heart can feel sorrow. These are emotions.

#### Will

Hebrews 4:12 reveals that the heart has intentions, indicating an aspect of the human will. Acts 11:23 speaks of the "purpose in the heart" which also shows that the heart has some level of willpower to purpose itself to do something.

### Spirit

#### Conscience

Hebrews 10:22 says, "Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience" indicating plainly that the conscience has much to do with the heart. 1 John 3:20 mentions that "our heart blames us." To blame is the function of the conscience.

## Gateway

While loving with the heart is the beginning of our relationship with God, it cannot be the sole source through which we enjoy God. In order to receive God in a real way, we need the spirit; we worship in spirit (John 4:24). Yet an exercised spirit still needs a pure heart.

A defiled heart defiles the spirit when it passes through such a heart. The soul contains all kinds of terrible things like pride, jealousy, and greed. The spirit does not contain evil things like the heart does. But when the spirit moves through the heart, it is contaminated and colored by the tainted elements of the heart. The spirit itself certainly does not have such elements, but in its release, the pride that is in the heart attaches itself to the spirit, and the spirit becomes a proud spirit. Sometimes the jealousy in one’s heart is attached to the spirit. When the spirit is released, it becomes a spirit of jealousy. If a man is humble and meek in his heart, he will appear to others as having a humble spirit. 

If the heart is not right, the spirit is not necessarily touched. However, the mouth speaks out of the abundance of the heart. When we say that a man has an improper spirit, we are actually saying that he has improper things in his heart, and that these things flow out with his spirit when he speaks or moves. When the spirit moves, it conveys various characteristic colors. These colors come from the heart. If a man is evil in some way, his spirit will convey this evil to others. Therefore, we know a person’s heart by his spirit. 

## Enlargement

An enlarged heart is a trait given to many useful workers of God which implies an intimate concern for all men and especially all believers. Paul entreats the Corinthians to have such a heart as he had for them (2 Cor. 6:11; 2 Cor. 7:3) and even King Solomon had a large heart in addition to his wisdom (1 Kings 4:29). When the heart is enlarged, there will be more in one's heart that they have an intimate concern for - it is possible to genuinely care for all the saints in the entire country. This is a concern that is not limited by race, age, occupation, political affiliation, etc. Below are some biblical examples of largeness of heart:

1. Being strict with oneself but not with others (2 Cor. 6:13).
2. Humbleness; being proud is the expression of the narrowness of a person.
3. Forgiving others, and even forgetting what we have forgiven (Matt. 18:21-35; Eph. 4:32; Col. 3:13; Mark 11:25-26; Luke 15:20-24; Acts 7:59-60; Mark 11:25).
4. Caring for the things of Christ Jesus, and not one's own (Phil. 2:19-21).
5. Caring for the church, rather than individual spirituality and to be known as "spiritual" by others (1 Cor. 14:3-4, 12, 18-19; Matt. 23:5)
6. Having a heart for all believers and churches regardless of their condition (2 Cor. 11:28)
7. Caring more for the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem than any particular local church or one's own work (Eph. 1:22-23; 4:16; Col. 2:18; Rev. 21:2).
