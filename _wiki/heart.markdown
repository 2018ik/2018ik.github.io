## Biblical Basis

### Soul

The entire soul is contained in the heart. We can see this based on functions of the heart mentioned in the Bible.

#### Mind

Genesis 6:5 and Hebrews 4:12 reveals that the heart has thoughts, and Matthew 9:4 shows that the heart can think, indicating an aspect of the mind.

#### Emotion

John 16:22 shows the heart can rejoice, while 16:6 shows that the heart can feel sorrow. These are emotions.

#### Will

Hebrews 4:12 reveals that the heart has intentions, indicating an aspect of the human will. Acts 11:23 speaks of the "purpose in the heart" which also shows that the heart has some level of willpower to purpose itself to do something.

### Spirit

#### Conscience

Hebrews 10:22 says, "Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience" indicating plainly that the conscience has much to do with the heart. 1 John 3:20 mentions that "our heart blames us." To blame is the function of the conscience.

#### Relation to the Spirit

A defiled heart defiles the spirit when it passes through such a heart. The soul contains all kinds of terrible things like pride, jealousy, and greed. The spirit does not contain evil things like the heart does. But when the spirit moves through the heart, it is contaminated and colored by the tainted elements of the heart. The spirit itself certainly does not have such elements, but in its release, the pride that is in the heart attaches itself to the spirit, and the spirit becomes a proud spirit. Sometimes the jealousy in one’s heart is attached to the spirit. When the spirit is released, it becomes a spirit of jealousy. If a man is humble and meek in his heart, he will appear to others as having a humble spirit. If the heart is not right, the spirit is not necessarily touched. However, the mouth speaks out of the abundance of the heart. When we say that a man has an improper spirit, we are actually saying that he has improper things in his heart, and that these things flow out with his spirit when he speaks or moves. When the spirit moves, it conveys various characteristic colors. These colors come from the heart. If a man is evil in some way, his spirit will convey this evil to others. Therefore, we know a person’s heart by his spirit.
