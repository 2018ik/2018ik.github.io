## Background

The **New Testament** consists of the four gospels, Acts, Paul's epistles, Hebrews, the epistles of James, Peter, John and Jude, and Revelation. 

First are the gospels depict the life of Jesus in various ways: in Matthew He's the king-savior, in Mark He's the slave-savior, in Luke He's them man-savior, and in John he's the God-savior. In Acts after resurrection and ascension He now indwells the disciples and propagates Himself through His living witnesses. This book is called Acts because there is a group of people who are not God in the Godhead but are God in function i.e. they are the *acting* God.

In Romans Paul expounds on justification by faith, organic salvation, and how to live the proper church life. Then 1 Corinthians provides a more realistic depiction of the church life where there is much strife, but the solution to all these problems is actually just Christ Himself.

The four books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians and Colossians can be considered the heart of the divine revelation. The ordering of these books is very special.
Galatians reveals Christ versus religion, followed by the revelation of the church in Ephesians. Then, Philippians reveals the practical experience of Christ, and lastly, Colossians reveals Christ as the Head. We must first see Christ, who will lead us to the church, which leads to the daily experience of Christ, which all brings us to the Head.

## Significance

The New Testament is the practical fulfillment of the Old Testament. In just the book of Matthew, we see 11 times where a particular prophecy in the Old Testament is fulfilled. 
The reality of everything in the Old Testament is just Christ Himself. He is both the first and last name of the New Testament, making it clear what the main content is.

## Intrinsic Summary

The New Testament can be divided into three ministries of Christ Jesus: His earthly ministry which He carried out from His birth to prior to His ascension, His heavenly ministry which He is carrying out since His ascension to the present day, and His kingdom ministry which will be established at His second coming.

### Earthly Ministry

God was incarnated to be a man in the flesh (John 1:1, 14). Then, Jesus lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years, after which he was crucified to accomplish redemption for man's sin (Matt. 27:33-50). Afterwards, Christ was resurrected on the third day after His crucifixion (Matt. 28:1-7; Acts 10:40; 1 Cor. 15:4b). During the evening on the day of His resurrection He came to breathe the Spirit, whom He had become, as breath into His believers (John 20:19-22).

### Heavenly Ministry 

Christ ascended to the heavens, was enthroned, and received the crown of glory (Luke 24:51; Acts 1:9; 2:33; Heb. 2:9). Then, the ascended Christ poured out the Holy Spirit as a violent wind upon His believers (Acts 2:1-2). He sent out the apostles and disciples, upon whom He had poured out the Spirit, to different places to preach the gospel and establish churches. This is still occurring in the present day, during which the gifted ones among the believers build up the Body of Christ through the transforming Spirit. The coming back of Christ will end the church age and bring in His kingdom, the millennial kingdom (Rev. 11:15), in which He and His overcoming saints will be priests of God to serve God and kings to rule over the nations (Rev. 20:4, 6).

### Kingdom Ministry

In His coming back Christ will judge the saints and give the kingdom reward to the overcoming ones (2 Cor. 5:10). He will marry the the overcomers as His spouse, who will be His army to defeat Antichrist, the false prophet, and the rebel nations (Rev. 19:7-9, 11-16). The Antichrist and the false prophet will also be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 19:19-21) and Satan will cast into the abyss for 1000 years (20:1-3) during which the millennial kingdom begins (Rev 19:4-6).

At His coming back to the earth, Christ will be on the throne of His glory to judge the remaining living ones (Acts 10:42; 2 Tim. 4:1). Some as goats will be condemned to perish eternally, and some as sheep will be justified to enter into eternal life (Matt. 25:31-46). After the 1000 years, Satan will be released and rebel with the nations. The nations will be devoured by fire from heaven, and Satan will be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:7-10). Then Christ will judge all the dead throughout history (Rev. 20:11-12, 15). Finally, there is a new heaven and new earth, where the New Jerusalem descends to (21:1-2).
