>"After my study of the Bible for the past sixty-nine years, what have I seen? I would say that I have seen the New Jerusalem. This is my vision, this is my revelation, and this is my ministry."

\- Practical Points Concerning Blending, pp. 25-26

## Background
In the gospels we see the wonderful biography of this living God-man. In Matthew He's the king savior, in Mark He's the slave savior in Luke He's them an savior and in John he's the God savior.

Then in Acts after resurrection and ascension now indwells the disciples and propagates Himself everywhere through His living witnesses. We call this book Acts because we have a group of people who are not God in the Godhead but are God in function i.e. they are the *acting* God.

In Romans we see the ideal church life described in chapters 12 to 16.

Then we come to 1 Corinthians which is a more realistic depiction of the church life.
