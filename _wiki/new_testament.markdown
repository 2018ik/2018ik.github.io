## Background

In the gospels we see the wonderful biography of this living God-man. In Matthew He's the king savior, in Mark He's the slave savior in Luke He's them an savior and in John he's the God savior.

Then in Acts after resurrection and ascension now indwells the disciples and propagates Himself everywhere through His living witnesses. We call this book Acts because we have a group of people who are not God in the Godhead but are God in function i.e. they are the *acting* God.

In Romans we see the ideal church life described in chapters 12 to 16.

Then we come to 1 Corinthians which is a more realistic depiction of the church life.

## Signifiance

Christ is the first and last name of the New Testament, making it clear what the main content is.

### Instrinsic Significance

The New Testament is the practical fulfillment of the Old Testament. In just the book of Matthew, we see 11 times where a particular prophecy in the Old Testament is fulfilled.

## Synopsis

The New Testament can be divided into three ministries of Christ Jesus: His earthly ministry which He carried out from His birth to prior to His ascension, His heavenly ministry which He is carrying out since His ascension to the present day, and His kingdom ministry which will be established at His second coming.

### Earthly Ministry

God was incarnated to be a man in the flesh (John 1:1, 14). Then, Jesus lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years, after which he was crucified to accomplish redemption for man's sin (Matt. 27:33-50). Afterwards, Christ was resurrected on the third day after His crucifixion (Matt. 28:1-7; Acts 10:40; 1 Cor. 15:4b). During the evening on the day of His resurrection He came to breathe the Spirit, whom He had become, as breath into His believers (John 20:19-22).

### Heavenly Ministry 

Christ ascended to the heavens, was enthroned, and received the crown of glory (Luke 24:51; Acts 1:9; 2:33; Heb. 2:9). Then, the ascended Christ poured out the Holy Spirit as a violent wind upon His believers (Acts 2:1-2). He sent out the apostles and disciples, upon whom He had poured out the Spirit, to different places to preach the gospel and establish churches. This is still occurring in the present day, during which the gifted ones among the believers build up the Body of Christ through the transforming Spirit. The coming back of Christ will end the church age and bring in His kingdom, the millennial kingdom (Rev. 11:15), in which He and His overcoming saints will be priests of God to serve God and kings to rule over the nations (Rev. 20:4, 6).

### Kingdom Ministry

In His coming back Christ will judge the saints and give His kingdom as a reward to the saints justified by Him (2 Cor. 5:10). He will marry the justified, overcoming saints as His spouse, who will be led by Him as His overcoming army to defeat Antichrist with his partner, the false prophet, and the nations who follow them in rebelling against God (Rev. 19:7-9, 11-16); He will cast Antichrist and the false prophet into the lake of fire (vv. 19-21); in the meantime, Satan will be bound for a thousand years and cast into the abyss (20:1-3); and then the millennial kingdom of Christ will begin (vv. 4-6).
At His coming back to the earth, Christ will be on the throne of His glory to judge the nations (the living—Acts 10:42; 2 Tim. 4:1) who remain at that time—some as goats will be condemned to perish eternally, and some as sheep will be justified to enter into eternal life—Matt. 25:31-46.
At the end of the millennial kingdom, Satan will be released and will deceive the nations again to rebel against God; the nations will be devoured by fire from heaven, and Satan will be cast into the lake of fire—Rev. 20:7-10.
After the millennium Christ will be on His great white throne to judge all the dead throughout the generations and cast them into the lake of fire—vv. 11-12, 15.
The new heaven and new earth will come, in which the holy city, New Jerusalem, is manifested—21:1-2. [113]
