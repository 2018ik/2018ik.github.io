>"For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the lw of sin and of death"

\- Rom. 8:2

## Background

In Romans 8, there is a law which Paul calls the **law of the Spirit of life** which frees us from the law of sin and of death. This verse speaks of four matters: a law, the Spirit, life and Christ Jesus. Christ Jesus is the Spirit, and the Spirit is life, and this life has a law.

Law here is used in a scientific manner, and denotes a principle which operates automatically and spontaneously. In every life there is a law: a seed of a red flower will always produce a red flower, and a chicken will always lay chicken eggs. There is no need to worry that some other animal will hatch from them. This is because each life is [regulated](../regulation) by the law of that life.
