>"For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the lw of sin and of death"

\- Rom. 8:2

## Background

In Romans 8, we see a law which Paul calls the **law of the Spirit of life** which frees us from the law of sin and of death. This verse speaks of four matters: a law, the Spirit, life and Christ Jesus. Christ Jesus is the Spirit, and the Spirit is life, and this life has a law.

Law here is used in a scientific manner, and denotes a working principle which operates spontaneously.
