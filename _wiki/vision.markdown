## Background

A **vision** is a spectacular sight from God revealing His desire on earth today. A vision always comes with a divine commission and a burden for God's move, which is carried out through the ministry. It is up to the receiver of a vision whether or not they want to obey it (Acts 26:19), however when we truly see a genuine vision, it will change our destiny forever. When the magi saw Christ and received divine instruction, they took *another way* to their own country (Matt. 2:12). On the other hand, where there is no vision, there is no restraint and everyone does what is right in their own eyes (Prov. 29:18). 

When a person receives a vision, they lose all self-confidence and live a life of co-dependence on the Lord. A vision converts a person from everything to Christ Himself; He will be the inner-operating-God to them, energizing them to carry out His plan (Gal 1:15-16). Although believers see many subjective visions, they are all based on the vision of the age - what God wants His people to do during a particular period of time - of which there is always one.

Revelation is required for seeing a vision. The difference is that revelation is an initial receiving of some truth, whereas a vision is a further consideration of the revelation which issues in a move and truly controls one's life. While a revelation allows one to understand and teach a divine fact, a vision allows one to be directed, even willingly martyred for what they have seen. To see a vision also does not imply experiencing the things within the vision. Jacob and Joseph both experienced visions far beyond what they've experienced at the time. By faith we must speak according to the vision we've seen, not our experience, and the vision will eventually become our experience.

## Significance

A vision is the holding factor of one's walk individually and the one accord corporately. What one lacks in vision is made up for by following persons, doctrines, traditions and things other than God Himself. A clear vision as what Paul saw is what directs a person's walk steadfastly for the rest of their life. Furthermore, if everyone has the same vision, they will have one heart, one mouth, one voice, and one tone. There will be no arguments and differing opinions. Everyone will speak the same thing, think the same thing, and press on in one accord (Phi. 2:2).

## Receiving

Vision = Revelation + Light + Sight

Paul's supplication for the church in Ephesus that they may see the vision was for them to have a spirit of wisdom and **revelation**, and that the **eyes** of their heart may be **enlightened** (Eph. 1:17-18). Here there is revelation (which is an issuing of the aforementioned wisdom), light, and sight. To see a vision, one must constantly muse upon and pray over the revelations that they have received. Without adequate prayer, even revelations can remain as mere doctrine.

## Commission

### Forgetting

We must have a desire in our heart to be directed the vision we see, as it is possible to forget and disobey the vision. For example, Peter received vision that Jesus was Christ, but then proceeded to be one with Satan (Matt. 16). He appears to have also forgotten about it in the subsequent chapter on the mountain (Matt. 17:4; 17:25).

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>As the divine revelation results in the vision, so does the vision result in Godâ€™s move. God wants to move on earth to accomplish His economy, but this move has to be carried out by man, who has to choose to carry this will out. This is a move in the spiritual sense, but outwardly, God is literally moving to establish more churches for the building up of the Body.
>
>In the New Testament, the disciples first received revelation, based on all of the things which Jesus did and taught. This revelation became a vision to disciple all the nations and to declare His name to all the entire inhabited earth. Then, the move was carried out when the Holy Spirit fell upon them. The move is altogether based on divine revelation. For example, the Spirit directed Paul to various countries, and directed Peter to evangelize the gentiles. Anything that God has not revealed is not true, and we can ignore it. Any genuine move of God will be based on divine revelation, which comes from the Word of God.
