## Background

A vision is God revealing to man his desire on earth today. With a vision always comes a divine commission and a burden for God's move, which is carried out through the ministry. It is up to the receiver of a vision whether or not they want to obey it (Acts 26:19), however when we truly see a geniune vision, it is easier to obey it than to ignore it.

When we receive a vision, we lose all our self-confidence, we need to live a life of co-dependence on Him. A vision converts us from everything to Christ Himself; He will be the inner operating God to us, energizing us to carry out His plan (Gal 1:15-16). Although believers see many subjective visions, they are all based on the vision of the age - what God wants His people to do during a particular period of time - of which there is always one.

Revelation is required for seeing a vision. The difference is that revelation is an initial receiving of some truth, whereas a vision is a further consideration of the revelation which issues in a move and truly controls one's life.

## Significance

A vision keeps the one accord. If everyone has the same vision, they will have one heart, one mouth, one voice, and one tone. We should have no arguments and differing opinions, we should all speak the same thing, think the same thing, an press on in one accord (Phi. 2:2).

We must have a desire in our heart to be directed the vision. For example, Peter received vision that Jesus was Christ, but then proceeded to be one with Satan (Matt. 16).

## Equation

Vision = Revelation + Light + Sight

Paul's supplication for the church in Ephesus that they may see the vision was for them to have a spirit of wisdom and **revelation**, and that the **eyes** of their heart may be **enlightened** (Eph. 1:17-18). Here there is revelation (which is an issuing of the aforementioned wisdom), light, and sight.

## Commission

### Forgetting

It is possible to forget about a vision after seeing it. For example, Peter received a vision if Matthew 16, but forgot about it in the subsequent chapter (Matt. 17:4; 17:25).
