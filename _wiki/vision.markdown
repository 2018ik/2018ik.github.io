## Background

A vision is God revealing to man his desire on earth today. With a vision always comes a divine commission, which in order to carry out is through the ministry. It is up to the receiver of a vision whether or not they want to obey it (Acts 26:19).

When we receive a vision, we lose all our self-confidence, we need to live a life of co-dependence on Him. A vision converts us from everything to Christ Himself; He will be the inner operating God to us, energizing us to carry out His plan (Gal 1:15-16).

Although believers see many subjective visions, they are all based on the vision of the age - what God wants His people to do during a particular period of time - of which there is always one.

## Significance

A vision keeps the one accord. If everyone has the same vision, they will have one heart, one mouth, one voice, and one tone. We should have no arguments and differing opinions, we should all speak the same thing, think the same thing, an press on in one accord (Phi. 2:2).

We must have a desire in our heart to be directed the vision. For example, Peter received vision that Jesus was Christ, but then proceeded to be one with Satan (Matt. 16).

## Commission

### Forgetting

It is possible to forget about a vision after seeing it. For example, Peter received a vision if Matthew 16, but forgot about it in the subsequent chapter (Matt. 17:4; 17:25).
