## Background

When we receive a vision, we lose all our self-confidence, we need to live a life of co-dependence on Him. A vision converts us from everything to Christ Himself; He will be the inner operating God to us, energizing us to carry out His plan (Gal 1:15-16).

With a vision always comes a commission, which in order to carry out is through the ministry.


## Visions in the Bible

### Noah's Ark

Noah received a vision from God concerning what God wanted to at that particular time. He wanted a new beginning with mankind through Noah, so He gave him the vision of the ark. The commission here is to do the building work. 
Noah's Ark only has one window on the highest floor. 

### Moses

Moses saw the burning bush, and showed Moses how to begin the exodus from Egypt, as well as further on how to build the tabernacle for God's habitation on the earth.

### David

God wanted man to build Him a temple in the good land, so he gave David a vision of what God wanted to do. He also gave David a commission, but due to David's failure, the commission was given to Solomon, who built according to David's vision.

### Jesus

He has God's vision, and knew exactly what God wanted to do. Everyone at that time could only serve God under the vision which Jesus saw. Unsurprisingly, the Lord did everything in coordination with God the Father to carry out the commission from manger to cross to resurrection to ascension to descension.

### The New Jerusalem

John saw the vision of the New Jerusalem in his 90s, as he wrote in the Book of Revelation.

## An All-Inclusive Vision of Today

Our current vision of the age extends all the way from Adam's vision of the tree of life in the garden of Eden to the New Jerusalem with the tree of life. 

We should not merely serve God based on a single vision in the Bible; our vision must include all scenes. However the goal of our service, must ultimately consummate in the final vision of the Bible: the New Jerusalem.
