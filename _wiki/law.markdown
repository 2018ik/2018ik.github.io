## Background

Law is God's principle in dealing with man in His Old Testament economy. God decreed the law as a portrait of Himself and a standard of good to expose man of his inability to keep the law and to cause him to know his sin (Rom 3:20, Rom 7:7).

The law itself is good and holy, but the intention of the law is to show us our sin. Through the law is clear knowledge of sin, and if man tries to keep the law he will not be justified by God because God's standard of righteousness is His own righteous being and no fallen being can meet the standard of God's righteousness which his himself portrayed in the law.


## History

The law was brought in not from the beginning, but after transgression. 

God's original intention in creating man as a vessel was to receive the Lord Jesus as the tree of life. By eating the tree of life, man would have fulfilled the desire of God, to contain and express God in His glory.

Instead, man ate the tree of knowledge of good and evil and was condemned by God. This caused man to take in another source, the life and nature of Satan, which issues in death. The issue was not an immediate physical death, but that the spirit was deadened. 

Now man is in another situation - his soul has become independent of God, and has become the self. The Satanic life and nature caused man to become flesh, and his whole being has become deadened. Man himself has become a constitution of flesh.

Yet, fallen man did not know himself and strived to do good to improve himself (Exo. 19:8). Man's inclination was to keep the law, and to do good. This is also the condition of fallen men today (Rom. 7).

## Example

Paul says in Romans that he did not know coveting, except through the law. It is the law which causes us to know sin.

## Romans 7

### Three Lives
In Romans 7, we have three lives as a regenerated human being - the Divine life in our spirit, the human life in our soul, and the Satanic life in the flesh.

### Four laws

1. The law of God

This law shows us this portrait of who God is as love, light, holiness and righteousness. 

2. The law of good

This law is present in our mind and desires to do the good, and causes us to want to choose to follow the law of God.

3. The law of sin and of death

This law in our flesh is stronger than the law of good in our mind. While we make the resolution to do good in order to fulfill the law of God, this law of sin and of death will inevitably overcome us and cause us to fail.

4. The law of the Spirit of life

This law is installed in our spirit, and this is the most powerful law, and overcomes the law of sin and of death. By turning to our spirit, this law spontaneously activates, and allows us to fulfill the law of God.

## Curse

Galatians 3:10 says that those under the works of the law are under a curse. For example, everyone has a temper, and occasionally gets upset and irritated. If we attempt to exercise the law of good in our mind because we know it's not good to lose our temper, we will find that we fail due to the law of sin and of death in our fleshly members. 

## The Flesh

The law is related to the flesh, an the flesh inclines to keep the law (Rom. 7:5). 

## Positive function of the law

The law has a positive function, that is to expose sin. After all, the law in an of itself is holy and good. So we don't despise the law. 

For example, in the Old Testament, after transgressing God's law, there is the conviction of sin. The law may even require that one to be put to death. There however is a provision: the trespass offering. By exposing such a sin, the sinner is conducted unto God through the trespass offering. 

## End of the Law

In the New Testament, Christ's coming is the end of the law (Rom. 10:17). We are justified when we are joined to Christ through righteousness. This is by faith.
