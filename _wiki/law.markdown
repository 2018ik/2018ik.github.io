## Background

The **law** refers to the Mosaic law, that is the law of God (Josh. 24:26; Rom. 7:22) given in the Old Testament to the children of Israel and was God's principle in dealing with man in the Old Testament.  The law included moral commandments as well as ritual commandments in ordinances. Strictly speaking, it is the latter that is abolished (Eph 2:15), yet the former moral commandments cannot be kept by the flesh. To keep the law with fleshly works is to nullify the grace of God (Gal. 2:21).

Paul declares to the New Testament believers that He has died to law that he might live to God (Gal. 2:19), and that if righteousness is through the law, then Christ has died for nothing (Gal. 2:21). A question followers of laws and ordinances should ask themselves is as follows: "If you died with Christ from the elements of the world, why, as living in the world, do you subject yourself to ordinances?" (Col. 2:20).

The law itself is good and holy (Rom. 7:12), but the intention of the law is to expose man of his sin (Rom. 7:7; Gal. 3:23-24). Through the law is clear knowledge of sin, and if man tries to keep the law he will not be justified by God because God's standard of righteousness is His own righteous being and no fallen being can meet this standard. God decreed the law as a portrait of Himself and a standard of good to expose man of his inability to keep the law and to cause him to know his sin (Rom 3:20, Rom 7:7). 

## History

The law was brought in not from the beginning, but after transgression. God's original intention in creating man as a vessel was to receive the Lord Jesus as the tree of life. By eating the tree of life, man would have fulfilled the desire of God, to contain and express God in His glory. Instead, man ate the tree of knowledge of good and evil and was condemned by God. This caused man to take in another source, the life and nature of Satan, which issues in death. The issue was not an immediate physical death, but that the spirit was deadened. Now man is in another situation - his soul has become independent of God, and has become the self. The Satanic life and nature caused man to become flesh, and his whole being has become deadened. Man himself has become a constitution of flesh.

Even after the fall, God allowed man to govern themselves. It was only after the situation at Babel that He intervened and called out to Abraham. At Babel mankind's rebellion toward God reach its peak, so He scattered them and confounded their language. Thus, God called out Abraham in order to fulfill His purpose in man, furthermore according to the principle of faith. It was Abraham's believing which was accounted to him as righteousness (Rom. 4:3; Gal. 3:6). [*This was possible because God knew that He would justify the Gentiles out of faith by the eternal blood of Jesus (Heb. 9:14)*]. The land promised to Abraham would be fulfilled in the New Testament by the promise of the Spirit.

Christ then came at the fullness of the time, the exact right time (Gal. 4:4). God waited until the law was added through Moses because of continued transgressions and for the children of Israel to be fully exposed of their corruption and helplessness. Christ's coming is the end of man's obligation to keep the law. Through His death and resurrection, no longer is man bound by law to the old man, but rather justified by faith that they may live to God (Gal. 2:19-22).

## Curse

Galatians 3:10 says that those under the works of the law are under a curse. This is because the flesh is sin, and attempts to keep the law according to the flesh will never succeed (Rom. 7:5). It is the curse of inevitably failing to keep the works of the law and being condemned as a result. For example, everyone has a temper, and occasionally gets upset and irritated. If we attempt to exercise the law of good in our mind because we know it's not good to lose our temper, we will find that we fail due to the law of sin and of death in our fleshly members. 

## Purpose

### To Testify of God

God decreed the law as a portrait of Himself and a standard of good to expose man of his inability to keep the law and to cause him to know his sin (Rom 3:20, Rom 7:7). 

### To Govern Man

Galatians 3:23 reveals that the Israelites were guarded under law. This is to be kept in custody, such as sheep enclosed in a fold (John 10:1). This is to prevent God's people from further degradation until Christ came. Accordingly today, Christians parents such preach the law to their children that it may govern them. The law will serve as a custodian and a child-conductor (Gal. 3:24) unto Christ until they are eventually saved.

As a custodian, the law could not give life. The Spirit in contrast makes believers sons of God with life, maturity, position and rights. 

### To Expose Sin

The law has a positive function to expose sin. For example, in the Old Testament, after transgressing God's law, there is the conviction of sin. In fact, the law was *added* because of transgressions (Gal. 3:19). In the Old Testament, the law may even require that one to be put to death. There however is a provision: the trespass offering. By exposing such a sin, the sinner is conducted unto God through the trespass offering. 

In the New Testament, man attempts to fulfill the law, but the evil will be present which causes man to fail (Rom. 7:21). This turns man to Christ, the reality of the trespass offering, where there is no more condemnation (Rom. 8:1).

### To Conduct Man To Christ

Through the exposing of sin, a person realizes by the law that they are good for nothing but death and burial. This conducts man to Christ as their only hope.

This can be seen in the best practice for saving a drowning person. The lifeguard should wait until the drowning person has exhausted all effort and stops struggling before saving them. When a person loses all hope in their natural effort and stops their own doing, it is easy for them to believe and receive Christ.

## New Covenant

Although God's New Testament economy is centered on grace and faith rather than the law and works, as seen very clearly in the first two chapters of Galatians, there is still a "law" which applies as the "law of the Spirit of life" (Rom. 8:2). The law given to Moses was external, but Jeremiah prophesied of a new law that will be put in "their inward parts" and written on their hearts (Jer. 31:33). This verse is quoted in Hebrews 8:10 and 10:16 when speaking regarding the new covenant. 

This new law is not a law of letters, but a law of life (Rom. 7:6).
