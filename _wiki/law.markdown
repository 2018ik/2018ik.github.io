## Background

The **law** usually refers to the Mosaic law, that is the law of God (Josh. 24:26; Rom. 7:22) given in the Old Testament to the children of Israel, and was God's principle in dealing with man in the Old Testament. God decreed the law as a portrait of Himself and a standard of good to expose man of his inability to keep the law and to cause him to know his sin (Rom 3:20, Rom 7:7). In the Old Testament, there was both the law of moral commandments, as well as ritual commandments in ordinances. It is the latter that is abolished (Eph 2:15), yet, the former is not to be kept out of self-effort (Gal 2:19-21).

The law itself is good and holy (Rom. 7:12), but the intention of the law is to show us our sin (Rom. 7:7; Gal. 3:23-24). Through the law is clear knowledge of sin, and if man tries to keep the law he will not be justified by God because God's standard of righteousness is His own righteous being and no fallen being can meet this standard.

## History

The law was brought in not from the beginning, but after transgression. God's original intention in creating man as a vessel was to receive the Lord Jesus as the tree of life. By eating the tree of life, man would have fulfilled the desire of God, to contain and express God in His glory.

Instead, man ate the tree of knowledge of good and evil and was condemned by God. This caused man to take in another source, the life and nature of Satan, which issues in death. The issue was not an immediate physical death, but that the spirit was deadened. 

Now man is in another situation - his soul has become independent of God, and has become the self. The Satanic life and nature caused man to become flesh, and his whole being has become deadened. Man himself has become a constitution of flesh.

Yet, fallen man did not know himself and strived to do good to improve himself (Exo. 19:8). Man's inclination was to keep the law, and to do good. This is also the condition of fallen men today (Rom. 7).

## Curse

Galatians 3:10 says that those under the works of the law are under a curse. For example, everyone has a temper, and occasionally gets upset and irritated. If we attempt to exercise the law of good in our mind because we know it's not good to lose our temper, we will find that we fail due to the law of sin and of death in our fleshly members. 

## The Flesh

The law is related to the flesh, an the flesh inclines to keep the law (Rom. 7:5). 

## Function

### To Testify of God

### To Govern Man

### To Expose Sin

The law has a positive function, that is to expose sin. After all, the law in an of itself is holy and good. So we don't despise the law. 

For example, in the Old Testament, after transgressing God's law, there is the conviction of sin. The law may even require that one to be put to death. There however is a provision: the trespass offering. By exposing such a sin, the sinner is conducted unto God through the trespass offering. 

### To Conduct Man To Christ

Through the exposing of sin, a person realizes by the law that they are good for nothing but death and burial. This conducts man to Christ as their only hope.

This can be seen in the best practice for saving a drowning person. The lifeguard should wait until the drowning person has exhausted all effort and stops struggling before saving them. When a person loses all hope in their natural effort and stops their own doing, it is easy for them to believe and receive Christ.

## End of the Law

In the New Testament, Christ's coming is the end of the law (Rom. 10:17). We are justified when we are joined to Christ through righteousness. This is by faith.
