## Background

The **vines** in Canaan typify the sacrificing Christ who sacrificed everything of Himself to produce new wine to cheer God and man (Deut. 8:8; Judg. 9:13; Psa. 104:15). Christ as the vine in this context is a producer of wine, and is pressed, sacrificing Himself, to produce wine which cheers. 

## Experience

As with God, believers are often put into situations where they must sacrifice themselves in order to make others happy (Rom. 12:1; Eph. 5:2). Contacting the Lord in the midst of such a situation allows one to experience Him as the vine which cheers themselves, God and others. By experiencing Crist as the vine and by being fi

### Testimony #1 

> I came from the Roman Catholic church where there is no enjoyment. And when I came to the Lord' recovery I had the same reaction as Jacob, that is was a fearful place. But eventually, when you enjoy the Lord as the vine and receive the cheering wine, you become a little bit crazy, filled with joy. We are here to center everything on Christ Himself; this sacrificing Christ who is so lovely and so precious to us. I'm so thankful that we came to the church, we got with some "drunk" people so "mad" people who don't care about anything, who turn their entire being to the Lord Jesus Himself. He's the most precious and valuable one in the universe. In Acts 5:41 they went from the presence of the Sanhedrin rejoicing that they were counted worthy of being dishonored. You want to be for the Lord? How much do you want to be for the Lord? With regards to the Lord's Recovery, it is not my choice, it is the Lord's choice. People would say I'm too extreme, the word cult was used.

> About a week after I moved into the brother's house, I visited a young couple whom I was the best man was at their wedding. I spent about 10 minutes with them about why I moved into the brother's house. They asked me to leave, and referred me to Romans, "mark those who cause division." But then I realized, if we're serious about being disciples of the Lord, rejection will come. And I just felt so happy and so honored that I could be with those who will be counted worthy of being dishonored on behalf of the Lord. This idea that we want to be crazy lovers of Jesus, rejection comes, opposition comes. This is all part of the sacrifice.
