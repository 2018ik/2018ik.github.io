### Leaving the Garden

When Cain left the garden, he left both the face of the ground, and the face of God (Gen. 4:14). If we interpret this with the context that the earth was created for man and man was created for God, then we see that leaving the face of God *is* to leave the face of ground. If we are not living in the Lord's presence, we are usurping the reason why God created the earth.
