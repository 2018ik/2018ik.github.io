## Background

1 John reveals a **cycle of life**, in which *fellowship* brings in *light* which brings in *blood* which brings in *anointing*. This cycle can only be apprehended by our experience. 

The cycle begins with fellowship with the believers and with God (1 John 1:3). Then, God as light follows; with fellowship comes light, the two are inseparable (1 John 1:5-6). Thus, God shines on our person, exposing us of our sins, wrongdoings, mistakes, shortages, etc. God as light is the only thing which truly exposes our sin; this is not introspection, but a spontanenous and direct sense in our spirit.

Then, we apply the blood of Jesus which cleanses us from every sin (1 John 1:7). Actual and genuine cleansing occurs when one is in the fellowship of life and in the light. Lastly, the anointing in 1 John 2:20 and 27 follows the blood. This is according to the order in 1 John, as well as the ointment following the blood in the Old Testament (Lev. 14:14-18).

As a cycle, these four aspects repeat, giving us a deeper fellowship, a deeper light, a deeper experience of the blood, and a deeper annointing with each repetition. This issues in the building up of the Church, the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:16), which consummates in the New Jerusalem.
