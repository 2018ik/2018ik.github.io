## Background

1 John 1 reveals a **cycle of life**, in which *fellowship* brings in *light* which brings in *blood* which brings in *anointing*. This cycle can only be apprehended by our experience. 

As a cycle, these four aspects repeat, giving us a deeper fellowship, a deeper light, a deeper experience of the blood, and a deeper annointing with each repetition. This issues in the building up of the Church, the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:16), which consummates in the New Jerusalem.

## The Source: Eternal Life

The Gospel of John covers the matter of life. There are more references to life in John than all three of the other gospels combined. The eternal life is the zoe life.

This life is actually a person (John 11:25; 14:6) which moves and flows. This life is the source of, and issues in fellowship (1 John 1:2-3). As a person, this life comes into us and brings us into fellowship with God, and the rest follows.
