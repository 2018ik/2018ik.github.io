## Background

The **seventy weeks** in Daniel prophesy concerning the completion of the age, and can be split into three sections of seven, sixty-two, and one.

## Sections

### Seven

The first seven years 

### Sixty Two

The Lord needed to die on a specific year prophesied by Daniel, and on the day of the Passover.

### One

There is a great gap between the first sixty-nine weeks and the final week. At the beginning of this week, anti-christ will make a covenant with the nation of Israel. After three and a half years, this covenant will be broken and an idol will be set up in the temple, marking the beginning of the great tribulation.
