## Background

The Epistle to the Galatians has 6 chapters.

## Chapter 1

Paul shows that God's intention is to reveal His Son, Jesus Christ, in His chosen people (Gal. 1:16). God's desire is for His chosen people to receive His Son into them - this is the gospel.

## Chapter 2

Christ replaces the law and there is no reason to keep the law (Gal 2:16). Justification is by faith, but more pertinently, one must recognize that they have been crucified with Christ, and "it is no longer "I" who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" (Gal. 2:20). Living to the law is to nullify the grace of God. 

## Chapter 3

Paul tells the Galatians that it is foolish to take the way of the law, and attempting to perfect themselves by the flesh (Gal. 3:3), when they have already received the Spirit out of the hearing of faith (Gal. 3:2). Then, it is revealed that the promise given to Abraham "In you shall all the nations be blessed" (Gal. 3:8) prophesies concerning Christ as the unique seed of Abraham who brings the blessing to the nations (Gal. 3:16) by means of regeneration.

This blessing is actually the promise to give the Spirit to the believers (Gal. 3:14), a far superior reward to any promise of going to heaven.
