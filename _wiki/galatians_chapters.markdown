## Background

The Epistle to the Galatians has 6 chapters.

## Chapter 1

Paul shows that God's intention is to reveal His Son, Jesus Christ, in His chosen people (Gal. 1:16). God's desire is for His chosen people to receive His Son into them - this is the gospel.

## Chapter 2

Christ replaces the law and there is no reason to keep the law (Gal 2:16). Justification is by faith, but more pertinently, one must recognize that they have been crucified with Christ, and "it is no longer "I" who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" (Gal. 2:20). Living to the law is to nullify the grace of God. 

## Chapter 3

Chapter 3 verse 2 is the first time the Spirit is mentioned in Galatians. Whereas prior Christ is revealed, now it is the Spirit; while the first two chapters deal with God's economy, chapter 3 unfolds the experience of life.

In the first few verses, Paul may have been righteously angry as he argues with rhetorical questions that the Spirit is received by faith. Given that the Galatians were saved and received the Spirit, it was absurd that they would still attempt to perfect themselves by the flesh (Gal. 3:3).

Paul tells the Galatians that it is foolish to take the way of the law, and attempting to perfect themselves by the flesh (Gal. 3:3), when they have already received the Spirit out of the hearing of faith (Gal. 3:2). Then, it is revealed that the promise given to Abraham "In you shall all the nations be blessed" (Gal. 3:8) prophesies concerning Christ as the unique seed of Abraham who brings the blessing to the nations (Gal. 3:16) by means of regeneration.

This blessing is actually the promise to give the Spirit to the believers (Gal. 3:14), a far superior reward to any promise of going to heaven.

## Chapter 4

## Chapter 5

## Chapter 6

When Son is revealed in someone (Gal. 1:16), He will live in them (Gal. 2:20). Through this indwelling, He becomes real to them as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the reality of the blessing of Abraham (Gal. 3:14) and becomes formed in man (Gal. 4:19). The result of this Christ who is revealed, indwelling, subjectively all-inclusive and formed is the practicality of the new creation (Gal. 6:15).

God's economy is not out of works of the law, but the believers receiving the Spirit as the all inclusive and ultimate blessing of the gospel as the portion given to them as all the Triune God is, has done and accomplished that they might be joined to Christ in an organic union to experience Christ as life and become the same as He is in life and nature but not in the godhead.
