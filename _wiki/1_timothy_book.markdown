## Background

Paul's **First Epistle to Timothy** was written that he might know how to conduct himself in the house of God (1 Tim. 3:15). This was during a time of decline and, there was the need for the upholding of the truth and God to be manifest in the flesh. This is made possible by the proper living of the brothers and sisters.
