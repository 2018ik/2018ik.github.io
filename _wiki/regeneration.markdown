## Background

Regeneration is the first item of organic salvation, and involves being born of God to become children of God belonging to the species of God.

## Biblical Basis

Titus 3:5 says, "Not out of works in righteousness which we did but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit."

John 1:12 says that those who receive God have the authority to become children of God. This becoming is through a second birth of water and the Spirit (John 3:5). The next verse says that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. After one is regenerated, they are part of a new creation born of God who is Spirit.
