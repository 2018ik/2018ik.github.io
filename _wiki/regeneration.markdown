## Background

Regeneration is to generate the redeemed believers with the divine life, making them born of God to become children of God belonging to the species of God (John 1:12-13; 3:6). This is the first item of organic salvation, as is achieved through repenting and believing in the Lord through His Spirit. 

## Biblical Basis

John 3 refers to Nicodemus, who did not understand regeneration that is to be born anew in a spiritual sense. This regeneration is actually to be born of water (signifying death) and the Spirit (signifying life) (John. 3:5). The link between being born again and the term regeneration is seen in 1 Peter 1:23, which states that believers are regenerated not of corruptible seed of but of incorruptible. Corruptible seed refers to the fleshly seed of one's earthly parents, while the incorruptible seed is of God Himself. To be regenerated of incorruptible seed is therefore to be born anew into the divine race of God. 

Through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, all believers were regenerated unto a living hope (1 Pet. 1:3). This shows that after the life of Christ was released through his death, He can impart His life in resurrection to His chosen people. This hope is one to be further renewed, sanctified, transformed, conformed and glorified. 

Titus 3:5 says, "Not out of works in righteousness which we did but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit."
