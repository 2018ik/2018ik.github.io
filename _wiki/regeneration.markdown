## Background

Regeneration is to generate the redeemed believers with the divine life, making them born of God to become children of God belonging to the species of God (John 1:12-13; 3:6). This is the first item of organic salvation.

## Biblical Basis

Titus 3:5 says, "Not out of works in righteousness which we did but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit."

John 1:12 says that those who receive God have the authority to become children of God. This becoming is through a second birth of water and the Spirit (John 3:5). The next verse says that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. After one is regenerated, they are part of a new creation born of God who is Spirit.

Through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, all believers were actually regenerated in God's view unto a living hope 2000 years ago (1 Pet. 1:3). This is a hope of being renewed, sanctified, transformed, conformed and glorified.
