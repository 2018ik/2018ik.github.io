## Background

**Regeneration** is to generate the redeemed believers with the divine life, making them born of God to become children of God belonging to the species of God (John 1:12-13; 3:6). As the first item of organic salvation, being regenerated is not optional; all Christians must be born anew (John 3:7). This is achieved by repenting and believing in the Lord through His Spirit.

Through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, all believers were regenerated unto a living hope (1 Pet. 1:3). This shows that after the life of Christ was released through his death, He can impart His life in resurrection to His chosen people. This hope is organic salvation.

## Biblical Basis

In John 3, Nicodemus did not understand that regeneration is to be born anew in a spiritual sense. This regeneration is actually to be born of water, signifying death, and the Spirit, signifying life (John. 3:5). The link between being born again and the term regeneration is seen in 1 Peter 1:23, which states that believers are regenerated not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible. Corruptible seed refers to the fleshly seed of one's earthly parents, while the incorruptible seed is of God Himself. To be regenerated of incorruptible seed is therefore to be born anew into the divine race of God. 

Titus 3:5 further says, "Not out of works in righteousness which we did but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit."

## Purpose 

Neither the fallen human life, nor the Adamic life is can match God for [His purpose](../gods_economy). 

Jeremiah 13:23 says that as a Cushite's skin and leopard's spots cannot be changed, so is the sinful nature of the Israelites. Jeremiah 17:9 says that their deceitful heart is incurable. As a result of the fall, man's nature was utterly incompatible with God. However, even prior to the fall, God placed Adam in front of the tree of life, giving man the free will to choose the divine life. This indicates that Adam did not yet have the eternal life of God, only a neutral human life (further proven by Genesis 3:22). Mankind not only needs to be redeemed from sin, but regenerated - joined to Christ - in order to fulfill God's purpose in creating man in the first place.

Romans 7 paints a picture of a woman married to a husband representing the old man, the flesh, the fallen human life. The only way for us to be freed from such a life is for that life to be terminated, that is, for that first husband to die so that she may be married to the new husband, Christ. Verse 18 in the same chapter says that "in my flesh, nothing good dwells." The termination of the old man to be joined to the new man is a picture of regeneration.
