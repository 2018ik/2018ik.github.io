## Background

**Regeneration** is to generate the redeemed believers with the divine life, making them born of God to become children of God belonging to the species of God (John 1:12-13; 3:6). As the first item of organic salvation, being regenerated is not optional; all Christians must be born anew (John 3:7). This is achieved by repenting and believing in the Lord through His Spirit.

Through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, all believers were regenerated unto a living hope (1 Pet. 1:3). This shows that after the life of Christ was released through his death, He can impart His life in resurrection to His chosen people. This hope is organic salvation.

## Biblical Basis

In John 3, Nicodemus did not understand that regeneration is to be born anew in a spiritual sense. This regeneration is actually to be born of water, signifying death, and the Spirit, signifying life (John. 3:5). The link between being born again and the term regeneration is seen in 1 Peter 1:23, which states that believers are regenerated not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible. Corruptible seed refers to the fleshly seed of one's earthly parents, while the incorruptible seed is of God Himself. To be regenerated of incorruptible seed is therefore to be born anew into the divine race of God. 

Titus 3:5 further says, "Not out of works in righteousness which we did but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit."

## Purpose 

Neither the fallen human life, nor the Adamic life is can match God for [His purpose](../gods_economy). Regeneration adds an entirely new life to a person's spirit, after which they must turn their heart to the spirit in order for this life to spread through their soul in further steps of organic salvation.

Jeremiah 13:23 says that as a Cushite's skin and leopard's spots cannot be changed, so is the sinful nature of the Israelites. Jeremiah 17:9 says that their deceitful heart is incurable. As a result of the fall, man's nature was utterly incompatible with God. However, even prior to the fall, God placed Adam in front of the tree of life, giving man the free will to choose the divine life. This indicates that Adam did not yet have the eternal life of God, only a neutral human life (further proven by Genesis 3:22). Mankind not only needs to be redeemed from sin, but regenerated - joined to Christ - in order to fulfill God's purpose in creating man in the first place.

Romans 7 paints a picture of a woman married to a husband representing the old man, the flesh, the fallen human life. The only way for us to be freed from such a life is for that life to be terminated, that is, for that first husband to die so that she may be married to the new husband, Christ. Verse 18 in the same chapter says that "in my flesh, nothing good dwells." The termination of the old man to be joined to the new man is a picture of regeneration.

## Items Gained

Here is a non-exhaustive list of things one received when they are regenerated:

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| New Heart | Our old heart is stone is changed to a soft heart of flesh (Ezek. 36:26) |
| New spirit | Our old spirit was a dead spirit. The new spirit is living (Ezek. 36:26; Eph 2:5). This is because the new spirit contains God Himself (see next item). |
| God | The entire Triune God makes His abode starting with the spirit (Phil. 2:13; Gal. 2:20; Rom. 8:16). From the time of one's regeneration, their mingled spirit *is* God (1 Cor. 6:17). As a corollary, a regenerated human spirit also becomes part of God. |
| Life | Christ is life and by living Christ we live a new life (Gal. 2:20) |
| Light | When one is in light, they are not in darkness. |
| Liberty/Freedom | Thee is no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus, and there is freedom where the Spirit of the Lord is (Rom. 8:1; 2 Cor. 3:17). |
| Anointing | The Holy Spirit of God begins to anoint us (1 John 2:27) |
| Law of Spirit of life | In contrast with the law of sin and of death, the law of the Spirit of life is the automatic principle that one will overcome all death when they exercise their spirit. |
| Sense of Life | The sense of life is a sense within one's intuition, also known as the teaching of the anointing. |
| The Spirit of Sonship | A saved one receives a spirit of sonship which makes them sons of God (Rom. 8:15; Gal. 4:5-6) |
