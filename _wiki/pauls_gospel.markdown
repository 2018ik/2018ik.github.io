## Background

Paul's gospel refers to that which he revealed in his New Testament epistles from Romans to Hebrews. This is not any different from the gospel that is revealed in the four books of gospel: Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, but a particular aspect of the gospel revealed by Paul.

Matthew, Mark, Luke and John speak of the kingdom, service, forgiveness and life respectively. These aspects of the gospels are not lost in Paul's writings. He describes the kingdom of God, as well as the characteristics of those who will inhereit it (Rom. 14:17; 1 Cor. 4:20; 6:9; 15:50; Gal. 5:21). He describes the importance of serving God (Rom. Rom. 12:1; Gal. 6:17). He describes very clearly how we were redeemed, justified and reconciled to God (Rom. 4:1; 5:10; Gal. 2:16). Lastly, we see repeatedly that God is being dispensed as life into the believers that we would be one with God in life and nature (Gal 2:20; 4:7; Eph. 1:23; 3:19). 

## Significance

Paul not only recovers the believers back to justification by faith in Romans and Galatians, but reveals that the Triune God has entered into man to build up the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12) which becomes the fullness of God (Col. 2:9-10), something that is altogether not revealed in the other gospels. In this manner, the gospel of Paul may be called the "completing" gospel (Col. 1:25). In order to carry out a truly impactful gospel for the sake of God's economy, not trying to please men but to pelase God (Gal. 1:10), this complete gospel must be preached.

## Biblical Basis

Paul clearly has a particular gospel to announce in his epistles which he calls *my* gospel (Rom 2:16; 16:25; 2 Tim. 2:8). The early church was foolish and fell back to Judaistic practices (Gal. 3:8), forcing Paul to correct them with the proper gospel (Gal. 1:6-7).
