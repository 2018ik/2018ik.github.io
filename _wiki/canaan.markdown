## Background

**Canaan** is the good land promised by God to the children of Israel, beginning with a promise to Abraham. 

In typology, there is always a battle for the good land which is Christ; all the battles in the Old Testament were concerned with the good land (Josh. 1:2-6; 5:11-6:27).

## Significance

Canaan typifies the all-inclusive Christ with His unsearchable riches as well as Satan's authority of darkness over the world. In particular, this can be seen in the division of the heavenlies seen in Ephesians. On one hand, the highest level of the heavenlies, the third heaven, is Christ. However the lowest level is ruled by Satan and the rebellious angels who follow him.

## History

Upon reaching the good land, the inhabitants of the land were demon possessed people, idol worshipers and Nephilim (Num. 13:33). According to the divine thought, these people had to be exterminated because they ere mingled with demons. 

12 spies were sent in to survey the land. Ten of them brought back an evil report, stating the land was inhabited by Nephilim whom they could not overcome. This caused all of the Israelites to become afraid of entering the goodnd, except two. This is Satan's strategy to keep the people of God from taking possession of and enjoying Christ as the good land. However, Joshua and Caleb thought otherwise and declared that the enemy was just food.
