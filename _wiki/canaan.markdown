## Background

**Canaan** (also known as the good land or promised land) is the land promised by God to the children of Israel, beginning with a promise to Abraham. 

There is always a battle for the good land; all the battles in the Old Testament were concerned with the good land (Josh. 1:2-6; 5:11-6:27).

## Significance

Canaan typifies the all-inclusive Christ with His unsearchable riches as well as Satan's authority of darkness over the world. In particular, this can be seen in the division of the heavenlies seen in Ephesians. On one hand, the highest level of the heavenlies, the third heaven, is Christ. However the lowest level is ruled by Satan and the rebellious angels who follow him.

In the last 2000 years, there has never been a ministry which has revealed Canaan as the all-inclusive Christ. 

## History

Upon reaching the good land, the inhabitants of the land were demon possessed people, idol worshipers and Nephilim (Num. 13:33). According to the divine thought, these people had to be exterminated because they ere mingled with demons. 

Ten of the twelve spies sent by Moses brought an evil report which caused the Israelites to revel against the Lord’s command. This is Satan's strategy to keep the people of God from taking possession of and enjoying Christ as the good land. However Caleb and Joshua disagreed, saying “you should not feat the people of the land for they are our bread.”  The Anakim (Num 14:9) represent the seemingly impossible situations in the pursuit of Christ.

Right after eating the produce of the good land, the manna ceased (Josh. 5:12). The children of Israel had to eat the yield of the land in that year.

## Application

It's one thing to know about the significance of Christ as the good land. It's one thing to enjoy a little barley there, a little wheat there. It's another thing for Christ to be literally everything - all and in all. Whether someone is laboring, working, serving or not doing anything, He should nonetheless be everything to them. When the believers are brought to this point, the Lord will be ready to return.

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>In my Google search the best that I could find about Canaan is that it is the rest. That's not hard to say based on the Hebrew definition. Then they would proceed to say that this rest would portray all the blessings and goodness we would receive, quite clearly implying going to heaven. In today's theology, Canaan is still going to heaven. Crossing the Jordan river of physical death, and going there by and by we would inherit all these blessings.

>The second blessing in this so-called sermon on the mount after the first one which is blessed are the poor in spirit, is this: blessed are those who mourn. I find myself getting into these materials on Christ as the all-inclusive good land to us in the depths of mourning in my being. Mourning for the earth of course, but especially for all of God's people who have been absolutely blinded by the leaven of heaven with no idea that this Christ is for us to gain and inherit and possess and partake of and experience and enjoy today. We of all people - a small number still - have seen or at least have heard something about this. But I within me I have this echo, this burden, that even we brothers and sisters in the Lord's Recovery: how much have we seen? How much vision have we received? How earnest are we in gaining this Christ day by day? Or as so many coming short of arriving at that rest due to disobedience, unbelief, rebellion.
