## Background

Suppose there is a wild olive tree growing in a region where nuclear testing occurred, so various toxic chemicals were mingled with the soil. And it also has terrible weather. And then you cut off a branch, and grafted it into a the world's best cultivated olive tree taken care of by the world's best gardener with the best weather. All of the history of the cultivated olive tree will become the history of the branch that is grafted into this tree. When we were regenerated, we were put into an organic union with the incarnated, crucified, resurrected and ascended Lord. But why is it that so little of His history is my subjective practical experience? This is because we don't live sufficently in our organic union with the Lord. The reality of this organic union is our mingled spirit. The practicality in which we are joined to the Lord is nothing less than our mingled spirit. Our human spirit born up, joined to and indwelled by the Spirit of Jesus Christ. As long as we live in our mingled spirit we will realize that in our very experience His history has become our history and that all that the Lord has passed through in His process of incarnation, living, death and resurrection are made more and more real to us. 

In John Chapter 11 mary and martha complained that He could've came earlier and save Lazarus, but the Lord is not the God of prevention but the God of resurrection. He destroys the old creation, yet builds up the new creation through the work of the cross and impartation of resurrection life respectively. No death, no life.
