## Background

The **organic union** refers to the life which God's regenerated people live in God's New Testament economy where they are joined to Christ in life, versus a judicial or legal joining. When one is organically joined to Christ, they are dead to the law, and are able to live Christ (Gal. 2:19). The only way to live to God is to be in an organic union with Christ. The only way for the organic union to be real in experience is through faith. This is not a natural faith which originates from man, but a faith that is of the Son of God (Gal. 2:20).

## Biblical Basis

### Two Husbands

In Romans 7, a wife is joined by law to the first husband, representing the old man. This is the "I" the natural life, which has become independent of God. This husband was placed under the requirement of the law. However, through the death of Christ, the laws demands (the wages of sin is death) were satisfied, and the old man was terminated. Now, in resurrection, the wife can be joined to the new husband, who is Christ.

### Olive Tree

Romans 11 has a picture of the grafting of a branch from a wild olive tree to a cultivated olive tree. With grafting there is the cutting and the joining, which is the organic union.

Suppose there is a wild olive tree growing in a region where nuclear testing occurred, so various toxic chemicals were mingled with the soil. And it also has terrible weather. And then you cut off a branch, and grafted it into a the world's best cultivated olive tree taken care of by the world's best gardener with the best weather. All of the history of the cultivated olive tree will become the history of the branch that is grafted into this tree. When we were regenerated, we were put into an organic union with the incarnated, crucified, resurrected and ascended Lord. But why is it that so little of His history is my subjective practical experience? This is because we don't live sufficently in our organic union with the Lord. The reality of this organic union is our mingled spirit. The practicality in which we are joined to the Lord is nothing less than our mingled spirit. Our human spirit born up, joined to and indwelled by the Spirit of Jesus Christ. As long as we live in our mingled spirit we will realize that in our very experience His history has become our history and that all that the Lord has passed through in His process of incarnation, living, death and resurrection are made more and more real to us. 

In John Chapter 11 mary and martha complained that He could've came earlier and save Lazarus, but the Lord is not the God of prevention but the God of resurrection. He destroys the old creation, yet builds up the new creation through the work of the cross and impartation of resurrection life respectively. No death, no life.
