## Background

**Intensification** is the last and current stage of the full ministry of Christ in three stages and centers around the sevenfold intensification of the all-inclusive compound life-giving Spirit seen in Revelation. In other words, this stage is an intensification of inclusion. For example, in inclusion we may have the Spirit of grace. In intensification, we have 7 times the measure of grace. 

Intensification is for Christ to:

1. Intensify His organic salvation
2. Produce the overcomers
3. Consummate the New Jerusalem.
