## Background

A **hemorrhage** refers to an uncontrolled flow, particularly of blood (Matt. 9:20-22). The entire human life is a life of hemorrhaging. We cannot control the bleeding of the fallen human life, that is, we are born to eventually die. This is the condition of all unregenerated humans on earth today.
