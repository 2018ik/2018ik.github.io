## Background

**The one thing** in Philippians 2:2 refers to the subjective knowledge, experience and enjoyment of Christ. Thinking the one thing is the pursuing of Christ to gain Him and possess Him. In order to think the one thing, believers must exercise their spirit of sober-mindedness (2 Tim. 1:7)

## Significance

If people think about things other than the one thing, which is to enjoy Christ, then their minds will be full of other things, and is actually to rebel against God's economy.
