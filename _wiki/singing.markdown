## Background

Singing to the Lord is to open one's being to contact God with spiritual songs. Singing is not just a matter of enjoying the tune or understanding the lyrics, actually, it requires turning to the spirit (1 Cor. 14:15). The goal of singing is inward, and is to bring the congregation into their spirit and into Christ, enjoyment is an issue and a side-effect, not the goal. To sing in an enjoyable way without touching Christ is a natural singing in the flesh, and not profitable for the church.

## Biblical Basis

In Exodus 15, after the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea, they sung songs of Moses and Miriam. In Exodus 21, when the children of Israel dug the well, they sang to the well to spring up. The well, representing Christ, had to be sung to in order to spring up. 

The 150 Psalms and the Song of Songs are compilations of poetry, songs and hymns which were enjoyed by Old Testament believers. Isaiah also sung to Jehovah (Isa. 12:5; 38:20; 42:10; 44:23) along with Jeremiah (Jer. 20:13).

Ephesians 5:19 says to speak to one another in psalms, and hymns and spiritual songs. Colossians 3:16 says to teach and admonish one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in one's hearts to God.

## Ways to Sing

### In the Heart

### Humming

God gave us the ability to hum. We should take advantage of that.
