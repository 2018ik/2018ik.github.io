## Background

Singing to the Lord is to open our being.

Don't be afraid to sing, don't sing silently; sing with melody and joy in your heart.

## Biblical Basis

In Exodus 21, when the children of Israel dug the well, they sang to the well to spring up. The well, representing Christ, had to be sung to in order to spring up.

## Ways to Sing

### In the Heart

### Humming

God gave us the ability to hum. We should take advantage of that.
