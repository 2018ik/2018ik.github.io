## Background

Freedom is found in Christ (Rom. 8:2; Gal. 5:1), and is in contrast with the law. If one tries to keep the law apart from Christ, they are under bondage of the law. On the other hand, the realization that one is in Christ and that it is not them but Christ (Gal. 2:20) frees them from needing to keep the law. Furthermore, as a result of being freed, those who are in Christ receive Him as satisfaction, rest and enjoyment.
