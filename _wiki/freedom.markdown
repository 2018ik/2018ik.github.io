## Background

**Freedom** is found in Christ (Rom. 8:2; Gal. 5:1), and is in contrast with the law. If one tries to keep the law apart from Christ, they are under bondage of the law. On the other hand, the realization that one is in Christ and that it is not them but Christ (Gal. 2:20) frees them from needing to keep the law. Furthermore, as a result of being freed, those who are in Christ receive Him as satisfaction, rest and enjoyment. 

## Four Aspects

Freedom in Christ has four aspects, one on the negative side and three on the positive.

### No Law

When one is free in Christ, they are freed from the obligation to keep the law. Christ had died once and for all so that all men can be liberated from law-keeping. 

### Supply

God's New Testament principle is to supply first by grace in order that the demands may be met. In Christ, He provides the supply for man to meet God's need in His New Testament economy.

### Rest

In freedom, man's labor and living is no longer in struggle and strife, but with Christ as rest. It is an impossibly difficult struggle to keep the law, to try to be better and try to be good. To find freedom in Christ results in rest from such obligations.

### Enjoyment

Enjoyment comes when one is freed from the law and they are supplied with rest.
