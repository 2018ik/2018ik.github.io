## Background

**Weakness** is ??? 

## Significance

Christ was crucified out of weakness, and we are weak in Him (2 Cor. 13:4). If the Lord Jesus was not weak, He would never have been arrested. He was willingly bound, tortured, and led to the cross with no self-justification. On the cross, He did not pull out the nails or come down in power. Likewise, for us to be crucified, we must be weak. By being weak in ourselves, we can live by the power of God.
