## Background

The out-resurrection refers to the resurrection in which the overcomers will receive the kingdom reward.

In His epistle to the Philippians, Paul was seeking for something more than the resurrection at the Lord's second coming (1 Thes. 4:16; 1 Cor. 15:52). This is the out-resurrection, an outstanding resurrection, and is the reward in the next age. This requires consecration today, to know the power of His resurrection, the fellowship of His sufferings.

## Significance

To obtain the out-resurrection, Paul specifies that He forgets the things which are behind (Phil. 3:13), and strives to be full-grown with the same mind i.e. like-souled with Christ (Phil. 3:15). This is to let go of everything old, and to lay hold of Christ and to let Him spread to every part of the soul.

A picture of the out-resurrection can be seen in Christ's human living. He counted the old creation as nothing, having been baptized and crucified. When He resurrected, He left His garments in the tomb, signifying the old creation. Leaving the tomb in resurrection with nothing of the old creation is the out-resurrection. This applies on two levels: in today's age, believers must be conformed to Christ's death (Phil. 3:10) and be crucified with Christ that they may live (Gal. 2:20). To take the cross and experience Christ's resurrection life today is to be in the out-resurrection today.

Then, at the Lord's second coming, the dead believers will be physically resurrected. Those who come out of the tomb, how much of the out-resurrection did they live in their previous life? That is, how much do they still hold onto things of the old creation? This is what determines whether they are part of the out-resurrection, the overcomers.
