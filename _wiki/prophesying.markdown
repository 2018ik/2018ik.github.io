>"...but he who prophesies builds up the church."

\- 1 Cor. 14:4

## Background

**Prophesying** is to speak on behalf of God to dispense Christ into others for the building up of the Body. This is not to convey information or psychological comfort, but to exhale the pneumatic word of God for others to inhale as their life supply (2 Tim. 3:16). God desires all of His believers to prophesy, and all believers have the capacity and obligation to prophecy (Num. 11:29; 1 Cor. 14:1; 14:31).

Primarily expounded by Paul in 1 Corinthians chapter 14, prophesying is for encouragement and consolation to men (1 Cor. 14:3), that is, the person who prophesies does so to build others up. In contrast, speaking in tongues only builds up oneself (1 Cor. 14:4). The recovery of all members prophesying is a key part in bringing forth the function of each member and overcoming the clergy-laity system.

## Significance

God desires a speaking people who can correspond with Him. The masses listening to a few is not the way to build up the church. The way to build up the church is for each member of body to function, and one of the ways to function is to speak for God, that is to prophesy. Therefore, prophesying fulfills greatest prophecy in the Bible, which is for the Lord to build up the church (Matt 16:18); this is not a physical building, but the Lord indwells the believers to build the church as the corporate Christ (see diagram below). 

When we speak, we impart life into the saints. Some saints may be going through a difficult time, and prayed over their situation, telling nobody. Yet, if we get into the word, and prophesy according to the inspiration of the spirit, we can speak exactly what they need to hear, since the Lord knows each one's situation (1 Cor. 14:24-25). 

Furthermore, when a person speaks regarding a particular burden, they themselves will be convicted upon violating that burden. For example, if a brother speaks about not loving the world, and yet fails regarding this aspect a few days later (e.g. buying some unnecessary luxury), he will feel greater conviction regarding this fact than if he did not prophesy. This conviction is what causes us to turn to the Lord.

## History

Meetings where one person speaks and everyone else listens is rooted in tradition, and is what is expected from a church meeting. However, Watchman Nee has noted since 1937 in *The Normal Christian Church Life* that this type of meeting has no place in the church. In his 1948 *Church Affairs* he said that this type of message meeting was according to the "customs of the nations" and charged all to push back on this unscriptural tradition.

This tradition continued in the Lord's recovery until 1984, when Witness Lee began working with the church in Taipei to transition from message meetings to meetings where each person speaks. After being trained for three years, the church in Taipei began practicing prophesying meetings as they are done today in November of 1987.

## Practice 

### Three Elements

Without these three elements, we risk speaking for ourselves rather than speaking for God.

1. Knowledge of the word - this is the human element of learning
2. Instant inspiration of the Holy Spirit
3. Vision concerning God's interest and economy

Loving the Lord to the uttermost is required for living a prophesying life (Psa. 45:1). This love is the essence of our authority, impact and power in speaking fo the Lord. 

### Preparation

PSRP allows us to prophesy with understanding. As opposed to traditional study methods, PSRP allows us to get life into us that we can speak it to others. We need to first find God's words in order to eat them (Jer. 15:16).

We must pray over the things we study as it gets us into the spirit; without this power the ministry of the word will not be enlivened and empowered.

### Prophesying Meeting

The point of this meeting is not about just sharing what we've enjoyed, but because we have a burden to build up the church. We should be filled with the things we are going to offer to the Lord during this meetings.

We must write down daily the spiritual enlightenment, inspiration, and enjoyment received from the Lord in His Word and put these points together to compose a prophecy of no longer than 3 minutes to speak in this meeting.

The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets means our own spirit is subject to ourself. Therefore, once there is any inclination or sense, and we would like to speak, we should get up and speak forth Christ.
