## Background

The **last Adam** in 1 Corinthians 15:45 refers to Jesus as the conclusion of the old creation. In His flesh on the cross He abolished every negative matter: Satan, sin, the world, the old man, the ordinances, etc. On the other hand, in Himself, He created everything positive as the second man of the new creation (1 Cor. 15:47; Eph. 2:15).
