## Background

**Walking by the Spirit**, as opposed to [living by the Spirit](../living_by_spirit), has the sense of carrying things out. One should learn to walk by the Spirit in small matters first, say, how one talks or dresses. Then, the large matters will be settled organically. 

## Daily Walk

The Greek word *peripateo* as in Galatians 5:16 is a habitual, daily walk. The result of this walk is the fruit of the spirit in verses 22 and 23. Love, joy, peace, etc. are normal things that should be aspects of an ordinary daily life. This is the same walk in Romans 6:4, 8:4 and Philippians 3:17.

>...so also we might **walk** in newness of life.

>...who do not **walk** according to the flesh but according to the spirit

>...observe those who **thus** walk even as you have us as a pattern.

This is an ordinary walk according to something general, such as newness of life, the flesh, or "us."

## Orderly Walk

The Greek word *stoicheo* (στοιχέω) as in Galatians 5:25 and 6:16 is a march in military rank. This is a more regulated walk than the first where an army is kept in step. This is the same walk in Romans 4:12,  Philippians 3:16, and Galatians 6:16:

>...but who also **walk** in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham."

>Nevertheless whereunto we have attained, by the same rule let us **walk.**

>And as many as **walk** by this rule...

Here, the walk is to conform to something specific, like the faith of Abraham or the rule he was talking about prior.
