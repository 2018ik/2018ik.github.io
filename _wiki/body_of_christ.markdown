## Background

The **Body of Christ** is the universal church and its relationship to Christ described as a body's living relationship to its head. All of God's chosen and redeemed people are constituted into one organic entity to corporately express Christ as His Body. A person's body is his expression, and this expression also has a measurable stature (Eph. 4:13). The riches of Christ have no stature, but the Body of Christ as the expression is the fullness of Christ to express His riches on earth.

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Being an organic, living entity | The human body is an organic entity with a life-flow circulating within it. Likewise, the Body of Christ is altogether organic with the life-flow of the Spirit. This is in contrast to the organizational, man-made hierarchies in some denominations. This does not mean there is no order in the Body, just that the order is an issue of life. |
| Being one | There shouldn't be infighting between members in a healthy body. All the members of the Body are one because the Body is one (1 Cor. 12:20). Thus, when one suffers, all suffer, and when one is glorified, all rejoice (1 Cor. 12:26). |
| Each member having a function | Each member of the human body has a particular function. Likewise, each member of the Body of Christ as their own function. In fact, each member has an allotted portion that no other member has (Col. 1:12) |
| Expressing the head | The head alone does not have a  stature, or expression of a person. There a big difference between seeing just a person's floating head versus their entire body. The Body expresses all that the Head is, even in a measurable way (Eph. 4:13). |
| Under the head | The Body of Christ is altogether subject to Christ the Head. The growth of the Body comes from the holding Head (Col. 2:19; Eph. 1:22). This is to take Christ as the first place in all things (Col. 1:18). |

The Body of Christ must be governing principle for the church, the ministry, and the work. These three things are distinct manifestations of the Body - for the expression, function in service, and increase respectively. The Body of Christ is obtained through a cycle involving minsters working to build up churches (see: ministry).

## Biblical Basis

Paul is the only writer in the new Testament to use the term "Body of Christ." A person consists of a head and a body, and is a living being. Likewise, the church consists of Christ as the Head and the totality of the believers as the Body, and is a living organism (Col. 1:18). A person's physical body is actually a shadow of the body of Christ. Each member with its own function, such as a person's foot, ear and eye are part of the same Body, and is part of the same corporate Christ (1 Cor. 12:14-18).

As Christ embodies God (Col. 2:9) and is God, so does the Body of Christ embody Christ and is Christ. In 1 Corinthians 12:12, Christ is used in apposition with "body" indicating that the Body of Christ is Christ. The reality of the Body of Christ is simply the Christ that is in all the believers as the Spirit, the life flow of the Body. As there is one Spirit, so is there one Body (Eph. 4:4). 

Saved ones are actually added to the Lord (Acts 11:24). This is to be added to the Body of Christ. This is then followed by the local church, where the believers are brought into Antioch (Acts 11:26). This shows that the local churches follows, and is the manifestation of the Body of Christ. Likewise, we are also baptized into one Body (1 Cor. 12:13).

## Reality Today

The reality of the Body of Christ refers to intrinsic content of the Body, which does not include the physical church buildings, nor does it include each members' old man. The reality is the sum total of the inner, new man of each member. The experience this reality is to see the consummated Body of Christ (the New Jerusalem) in the present day. To be in this reality requires living in the mingled spirit. The present reality is the precursor of the irreversible mutual involvement between God and man in eternity future that is yet to come.

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

> In about 1993 or so, Brother Lee was giving a conference on blending for the building up of the church. And he testified he was with the Lord considering the situation of all the churches and he was so encouraged just hundreds and hundreds of churches all over the earth. Then the Lord showed him - "I just considered the whole situation and I found no reality of the Body Christ." That was thirty years ago, and he brought that forth. We should not be content with the local church. There can be hundreds, thousands of local churches, but the Body must be built. When the Body is organically built, then the new man is grown unto maturity. And when the new man is developing surely then the Lord has the bride making herself ready.
