## Background

The **Body of Christ** is the **universal church**, consisting of His chosen and redeemed people who are constituted into one organic entity. This life flow of this Body is the Spirit; as there is one Spirit, so is there one Body (Eph. 4:4).

Paul is the only writer in the new Testament to use the term "Body of Christ." Those who see that they are members of the Body treasure the Body and honor the other members. The Body of Christ must be governing principle for the church, the ministry, and the work. These three things are distinct manifestations of the Body - for the expression, function in service and increase respectively. The Body of Christ is obtained through a cycle involving minsters working to build up churches (see: ministry).

## Biblical Basis

Saved ones are actually added to the Lord (Acts 11:24). This is to be added to the Body of Christ. This is then followed by the local church, where the believers are brought into Antioch (Acts 11:26). This shows that the local churches follows, and is the manifestation of the Body of Christ. Likewise, we are also baptized into one Body (1 Cor. 12:13).

A person's physical body is actually a picture of the body of Christ. Each member with its own function, such as a person's foot, ear and eye are part of the same Body, and is part of the same corporate Christ (1 Cor. 12:14-18).

## Reality Today

The reality of the Body of Christ refers to the experience of the consummated Body of Christ (the New Jerusalem) in the present day. That is, the present reality is the precursor of the irreversible mutual involvement between God and man in eternity future that is yet to come.

S.S. 1:6-8 -> S.S. 7:12
