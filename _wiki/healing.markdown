## Background

**Healing** is to be restored from a wounded state. By default, all humans are born with the wound of sin and require healing not only spiritually but psychologically and physically. 

## Etymology

The Greek word for healing means to be saved.

## Significance

Even after becoming a Christian, there are many aspects of one's life that must be healed. There are all kinds of things Satan uses to oppress us and keep us on the pathway to certain death. Today, we can be healed. We believe and we touch. 

## Biblical Examples
