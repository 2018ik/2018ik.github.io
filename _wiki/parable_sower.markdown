## Background

The **parable of the sower** is spoken by Jesus in Matthew 13, Mark 4 and Luke 8. The sower, representing the Lord, went out to sow seeds, representing the word of God, word of the kingdom, or the gospel (Luke 8:11-12; Matt. 13:19). This seed is sowed into four types of earth: the wayside, the rocky places, the thorns, and the good earth. These types of earth represent conditions of the human heart (Matt. 13:19).

| Earth | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Wayside | The wayside is hardened to such an extent that the devil can come and immediately snatch the word away (Mark 4:15). |
| Rocky places |  |
| Thorns |  |
| Good earth |  |

Wayside - couldn't even get in
Rocks - no place for root to go down, shallow, superficial, sunshines persecution afflictions come, over
Thorns - anxieties of this age, deceitfulness of riches, occupations, causes heart to be unable to bear fruit

When these things are dealt with absolutely, the soil will be tenderized and softened for the divine seed to have the proper growth to bear fruit.
