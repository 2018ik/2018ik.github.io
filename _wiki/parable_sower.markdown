## Background

In the parable of the sower, seeds, representing the word, is sowed into four types of earth: the wayside, the rocky places, the thorns, and the good earth.

Wayside - couldn't even get in
Rocks - no place for root to go down, shallow, superficial, sunshines persecution afflictions come, over
Thorns - anxieties of this age, deceitfulness of riches, occupations, causes heart to be unable to bear fruit

When these things are dealt with absolutely, the soil will be tenderized and softened for the divine seed to have the proper growth to bear fruit.
