## Background

The **firstborn Son of God** is in contrast with the only-begotten Son of God as the adjective firstborn clearly implies that He has many brothers (Rom. 8:29; Heb. 1:6). This is the status of Christ after His [designation as the Son of God in power](../christ_designation).

## Biblical Basis

Hebrews 1:5-6 refers to Psalm 2:7, "You are My Son; today I have begotten you" and 2 Samuel 7:14, "I will be a Father to Him, and He will be a Son to Me."

Galatians 4:4 says the Father has sent His son forth to be born of a woman under law which is His incarnation. This was to redeem those under law for justification. Then in 4:6, He sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts. This is for organic salvation. At the end of this age, He will send His Son once more as the firstborn Son of God so that He will rule over the earth in the millennial kingdom.

In Matthew 3:17, after the baptism of Jesus, a voice out of heaven said, "This is my Son, the beloved, in whom I have found my delight." The delight here actually indicates the firstborn Son of God, as this is after the baptism, which represents entering into death and exiting in resurrection. God only finds delight in the firstborn Son of God, the prototype in which the many sons of God are duplicated from.
