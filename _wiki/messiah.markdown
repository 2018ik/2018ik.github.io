## Background

**Messiah** is a title given to the Lord Jesus which means "anointed one." The anointing of the Son by the Father is to commission the Son to carry out God's economy.

## Significance

Only the Son is qualified to carry out God's commission on earth, and was anointed to do so. We can only carry out God's commission through the Son, the uniquely qualified one, being revealed in us, living in us and being magnified in us.
