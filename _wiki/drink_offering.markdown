## Background

The **drink offering** typifies Christ as the One poured out as the real wine before God for His satisfaction (Exo 29:40-41). This is in addition to the five basic levitical offerings; it was poured out on one of the five. Furthermore, when the offer enjoys Christ as the heavenly wine, they themselves become a drink offering as Paul was (Phil. 2:17) who can pour themselves out for God for His satisfaction. All believers are qualified to be a drink offering. 

## Biblical Basis

Jacob twice set up a pillar in Bethel, the first time he only poured oil and no drink offering (wine). The first time he only poured oil as it does not depend very much on experience of man's part. The first time he set up the pillar in chapter 28, he had little experience of the Lord and thus had little wine to pour out. Twenty years later after being touched by the Lord and having gone through transformation, he had wine to pour out upon the pillar as a drink offering to the Lord. The pouring of the oil which followed signifies the Spirit.

## Significance

The drink offering is the root of what is seen in Phil 2:17 and 2 Tim 4:6 where Paul refers to himself as a drink offering.

The drink offering is absolutely related to experience. The burnt, sin, peace, meal and trespass are basic offerings, but the drink offering was not. The five offerings in Leviticus are various aspects of what Christ is to God on our behalf. The drink offerings is something additional; if one of the basic offerings does not have a drink offering, then the offerer is likely poor.
