## Background

**Balaam** was a Gentile prophet who loved the wages of unrighteousness and was hired to curse Israel. 

## Significance

As a prophet who worked for profit, Balaam commercialized the prophetic ministry. This is not unlike Christian workers today whose end goal is to make a living for themselves. This is contrary to the principle that God will adequately provide all material needs (Matt. 6:20-34).

## Trivia

1. Balaam is the only person recorded in the Bible who had a conversation with a donkey.
