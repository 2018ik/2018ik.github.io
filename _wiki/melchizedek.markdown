## Background

**Melchizedek** (meaning king of righteousness) typifies Christ as the great high priest (Psalm. 110:4). His first and only recorded appearance was to bless Abram with bread and wine after his victory over Chedorlaomer and the other kings (Gen 14:18). Later in Psalms and Hebrews, Melchizedek is revealed to be a type of Christ (Psalm 110:4; Heb. 5:6). Unlike the Aaronic priesthood, the function of Melchizedek was not to offer sacrifices for sin, but to offer bread and wine in victory. Abram defeated his far out-numbering enemy because of Melchizedek's intercessory prayer (Heb. 7:25).
