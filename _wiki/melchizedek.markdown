## Background

**Melchizedek** (meaning king of righteousness) was the first priest mentioned in the Bible. He first and only recorded appearance was to bless Abram with bread and wine after his victory over Chedorlaomer and the other kings (Gen 14:18). Later in Psalms and Hebrews, Melchizedek is revealed to be a type of Christ (Psalm 110:4; Heb. 5:6).

## Significance

The first priest in the Bible was not Aaron, who offered sacrifices for sin, but Melchizedek, who offered bread and wine in victory. Abram also no doubt won the victory over his far out-numbering enemy because of Melchizedek's intercessory prayer (Heb. 7:25).
