The **parable of the lost coin** is one of the three parables in Luke 15. It depicts a woman lighting a lamp and sweeping the house to search for a lost coin (Luke 15:8-10).

## Significance

The Spirit enlightens the heart to search and cleanse it, before finding the coin, represented the Spirit reaching the spirit.
