## Background

## Three Stages

### Incarnation

Incarnation is for Christ to bring god into man, to express God in humanity, and to accomplish His judicial redemption.

### Inclusion

Romans 5:10 says that we need to be saved much more than just our judicial salvation. Furthermore, Christ as been begotten as God's firstborn Son, to become the life-giving Spirit, and to generate the believers for His Body.

### Intensification

This for Christ to intensify His organic salvation, to produce the overcomers, and to consummate the New Jerusalem.

We are currently living in the stage of intensification. The Lord has already been intensified.
