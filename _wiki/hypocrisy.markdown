## Background

Hypocrisy is to be contradictory in one's inward nature and outward appearance, for example in appearing outwardly righteous while remaining corrupt inwardly (Matt. 23:25-28).

## Biblical Exampels

### Achan

Achan coveted a beautiful Babylonian garment to make himself look better (Josh 7:21). This is to put on a garment which does not match one's actual condition.

### Ananias

Ananais and his wife Sapphita lied to the Holy Spirit by pretending to offer everything they had when in reality they had set aside some of their proceeds (Acts 5:1-11).
