## Background

Hypocrisy is to be contradictory in one's inward nature and outward appearance, for example in appearing outwardly righteous while remaining corrupt inwardly (Matt. 23:25-28). As a corollary, one's natural goodness and ability is false spirituality and is a great hindrance to the expression of the life of God. Hypocrisy is usually rooted in ambition, where a person may want to appear to be spiritual or godly to gain the favor of men.

## Biblical Examples

### Achan

Achan coveted a beautiful Babylonian garment to make himself look better (Josh 7:21). This is to put on a garment which does not match one's actual condition.

### Ananias

Ananais and his wife Sapphita lied to the Holy Spirit by pretending to offer everything they had when in reality they had set aside some of their proceeds (Acts 5:1-11).
