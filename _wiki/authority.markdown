>And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.

\- Matt. 28:18

## Background

**Authority** is the expression of God as the supreme ruler. This is the basis by which the gospel is preached (Matt. 28:19).

## Purpose

The authority of God primarily has two purposes:

1. To serve the saints, shepherd them, and build them up (2 Cor. 10)
2. To deal with the enemy and the things related to him (Gen. 1:26, 28)

On the positive side, authority is not meant to control people. Paul makes clear in 2 Corinthians 10 that His apostleship that is his authority was not for destruction but for building up. The elders and leadings one sin the churches have a certain authority to represent God but not for destruction and controlling but for shepherding the saints.

On the negative side, when God created man in Genesis he gave them authority; that is, a certain dominion to rule for Him and to defeat and subdue the enemy. However, man fell and as a result, rebellion entered and man lost his original authority over creation. After His resurrection, the Lord Jesus was given all authority over heaven and earth which is given to His disciples (Matt. 28:18-19).

## Deputy Authorities

>Let every person be subject to the authorities over him, for there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are ordained by God.

\- Rom. 13:1 

God chooses to delegate indirect authorities whom believers should be subject to. These can be work-related, religious or political authorities. For example, Paul was given authority to build up the Corinthians, who had been lead astray (2 Cor. 10:8; 13:10). Even Pilate was given authority by God to sentence the Lord Jesus (John 19:10-11). This means that being under God's authority is not an excuse to ignore deputy/delegated authorities, such as not paying taxes, but rather a subjection (Rom. 13:6-7).

## Under Authority

All authority comes from being under a higher authority. This can be seen in the case of the centurion in Matthew 8 who saw that the Lord Jesus was also a man under authority. The centurion's authority issued from his submission to a higher authority in the government. Eventually, the highest person in the government is under God's authority. Because the Lord Jesus was under the Father's authority, He possessed the authority of the Father.

The Lord gave man dominion over the creatures on earth (Gen. 1:26). The creatures only submitted to man because he submitted to God's authority. In the fall, man lost the authority of God and animals today are no longer subjected to man's authority. Not only can snakes bite us, but even mosquitos and flies can.
