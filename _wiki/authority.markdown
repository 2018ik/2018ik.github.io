>Let every person be subject to the authorities over him,for there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are ordained by God.

\- Rom. 13:1 

## Background

**Authority** is the expression of God as the supreme ruler. God chooses to delegate indirect authorities whom believers should be subject to. These can be work-related, religious or political authorities. For example, Paul was given authority to build up the Corinthians, who had been lead astray (2 Cor. 10:8; 13:10). Even Pilate was given authority by God to sentence the Lord Jesus (John 19:10-11). This means that being under God's authority is not an excuse to ignore deputy/delegated authorities, such as not paying taxes, but rather a subjection (Rom. 13:6-7).
