## Background

**Sufferings**, afflictions and tribulations is by the Lord's sovereignty that His people may realize that the only way for them to live is full dependence on God. Suffering can be for individual transformation, or for the Body. To suffer for the Body, that is to partake in the fellowship of the Lord's sufferings, one must know the power of His resurrection (Phil. 3:10).
