## Background

**Sufferings**, afflictions and tribulations is by the Lord's sovereignty that His people may realize that the only way for them to live is full dependence on God. Suffering can be for individual transformation, or for the Body. To suffer for the Body, that is to partake in the fellowship of the Lord's sufferings, one must know the power of His resurrection (Phil. 3:10).

## Purpose

There are three kinds of sufferings:

1. Everyone suffers since the whole world is fallen and under condemnation. This is for individual transformation.
2. Mistakes, doing something that should not have been done. This is for individual transformation. This technically includes ascetic suffering since asceticism is a mistake.
3. Suffering for the Body and for the gospel. This is for building up the corporate Body of Christ.

It is possible to suffer without gaining the benefit of suffering. There is a difference between suffering and taking the cross of Christ. The former is merely outward, while the latter results in a killing of the old man and the addition of resurrection life. To suffer victoriously, one must see Christ revealed in their suffering.
