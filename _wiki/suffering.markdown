## Background

**Sufferings**, afflictions and tribulations is by the Lord's sovereignty that His people may realize that the only way for them to live is full dependence on God. Suffering can be for individual transformation, or for the Body. To suffer for the Body means that a person chooses to suffer based on the Spirit's leading for the sake of the gospel. In order to do this, one must know the power of His resurrection (Phil. 3:10).  

Suffering for the Body always involves the cross - that the putting to death of Jesus (the working of the cross which Jesus went through) would be manifested in one's body (2 Cor. 4:10). The issue of taking the cross is for the life of Jesus to operate and for the Word to be ministered (2 Cor. 4:11-13).

## Purpose

There are three kinds of sufferings:

1. Everyone suffers since the whole world is fallen and under condemnation. This is for individual transformation.
2. Mistakes, doing something that should not have been done. This is also for individual transformation. This technically includes ascetic suffering since asceticism is a mistake.
3. Suffering for the Body and for the gospel. This is for building up the Body of Christ.

(1) and (2) are common to all human beings in the old creation, and are not the necessarily te working of the cross.  It is possible to suffer without gaining the benefit of suffering. There is a difference between suffering and taking the cross of Christ. The former is merely outward, while the latter results in a killing of the old man and the addition of resurrection life. To suffer victoriously, one must see Christ revealed in their suffering.

## Suffering for the Body

Suffering for the Body is to partake in the fellowship of the Lord's sufferings and fill up what is lacking of the afflictions of Christ for His Body (Phil. 3:10; Col. 1:24).
