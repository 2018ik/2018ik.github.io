## Background

Colossians unveils Christ to a fuller extend than any other book in the Bible. The reason why Colossians was written can be seen in Colossians 2:8:

>"Beware that no one carries you off as spoil through his philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ"

the items mentioned here are products of culture, and perhaps highly regarded by society. However, all of these things cause us to be veiled in seeing the truth.
