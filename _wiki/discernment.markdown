## Background

**Discernment** is to differentiate between life and death based on the sense of the Spirit. The secret to true discernment is whether something leads to further enjoyment of the Lord as one's life supply and to suffer persecution for the Body of Christ. 

For example, in preaching the gospel and shepherding new ones, discernment should be exercised for which ones are the most promising - because time is finite. On one hand, there should be a universal love for all, but on the other hand, the proper time should be allotted for those who need it.
