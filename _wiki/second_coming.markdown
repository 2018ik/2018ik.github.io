## Background

The Lord's **second coming** refers to His coming back at the close of the dispensation of grace.

In order for the Lord to come back, His bride needs to be made ready, which is the built up Body of Christ. This can only occur if believers corporately partake of the Lord's unsearchable riches to be His fullness. The Lord is not going to come back on some arbitrary date, the believers are able to hasten His return (1 Pet. 3:12).

## Significance

The world is hopeless, and all things defiled by the rebellion of Satan are to be dissolved. With this in view, each believer should consider that their living determines what they will be in the coming age (2 Pet. 3:11-12).

## Timeline 

### Fulfilled Signs

#### End Times

In the last days men will be lovers of self, lovers of money (Matt 24:37-39). In the present day, we even worship celebrities as idols. Morality has been slowly undermined and degraded that even our leaders who are supposed to be the pinnacle of such things are immoral. In God's economy it is the opposite - it doesn't matter what you can do or what you're good at - the person is what matters.

#### Restoration of Israel

Matthew 24:32 prophesies concerning the restoration of Israel.

### Last Seven Years

The second coming of the Lord takes place at the beginning of the last week of the seventy weeks of Daniel (each week signifying seven years).

#### Antichrist Rises Up

 A covenant will be reached between the Antichrist and Israel which will allow Israel to rebuild the temple. Ten kingdoms, presumably in Europe, will join together under the Antichrist. These are typified by the ten toes of the great human image in Daniel chapter 2.

#### First Hidden Rapture

Christ first comes in a hidden way, *parousia*. All the  overcoming believers still alive on earth during the second coming will be raptured to the air prior to the three and a half year great tribulation as the firstfruits to God and to the Lamb (Rev. 3:10; 14:1-6). However, the highest incentive for us to be the firstfruits is to satisfy God, not to escape tribulation. Then eventually, all the graves will open, and all will resurrect.

#### Great Tribulation

In the last three and a half years, Christ and the bridal army will be descending from the heavens in a hidden way.

Near the end of the great tribulation, the suffering will have sufficiently ripened the believers on earth at which point they will also be raptured (Rev. 14:15-16).

## Indicators

The below list of indicators for the Lord's imminent coming are all theoretical and may not actually be true:

| Indicator | Description |
| Testimony in Europe | Europe is the seat of the administration of the Antichrist. Before the Lord comes back, He must have a testimony in the land where the Antichrist rules. |
| Age gets darker | As in the days of Noah, the outward environment becomes degraded to the extent that the saints have no choice but to pray for the Lord to come quickly. |
| Growth of the church in Rome | The church in Rome, where the Roman Catholic church is overwhelmingly dominant, grows to a sizeable number of saints (150-200+). |
