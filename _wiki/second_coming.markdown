## Background

The Lord's **second coming** refers to His coming back at the close of the dispensation of grace.

In order for the Lord to come back, His bride needs to be made ready, which is the built up Body of Christ. This can only occur if believers corporately partake of the Lord's unsearchable riches to be His fullness. The Lord is not going to come back on some arbitrary date, the believers are able to hasten His return (1 Pet. 3:12).

## Significance

The world is hopeless, and all things defiled by the rebellion of Satan are to be dissolved. With this in view, each believer should consider that their living determines what they will be in the coming age (2 Pet. 3:11-12).

## Timeline 

### Present Age

In the last days men will be lovers of self, lovers of money (Matt 24:37-39). In the present day, we even worship celebrities as idols. Morality has been slowly undermined and degraded that even our leaders who are supposed to be the pinnacle of such things are immoral. In God's economy it is the opposite - it doesn't matter what you can do or what you're good at - the person is what matters.

| Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Gospel preached | People are saved by faith in Christ |
| Church is built | As lampstands expressing God in localities |
| Restoration of Israel | Matthew 24:32 prophesies concerning the restoration of Israel, which occured in 1948. | 
| Rise of Antichrist | A covenant will be reached between the Antichrist and Israel which will allow Israel to rebuild the temple. Ten kingdoms, presumably in Europe, will join together under the Antichrist. These are typified by the ten toes of the great human image in Daniel chapter 2. |
| Overcomers produced | Some believers mature and overcome the world, flesh, self, Satan (Rev. 2-3; Rev. 12:11) |
| Most believers remain immature | Most are saved but do not overcome (1 Cor. 3:12-15) |

### Tribulation

The second coming of the Lord takes place at the beginning of the last week of the seventy weeks of Daniel (each week signifying seven years). This seven year tribulatory period is called the "tribulation" while the last three and a half years is the "great tribulation."

| Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Temple is rebuilt on temple mount | This occurs at the very beginning of the Tribulation and marks the beginning of the final week (last seven years on the present age) |
| Israel forms covenant with powerful leader in Europe | This person will become the Antichrist |
| Attempted assassination on European leader | Someone will attempt to kill this leader, after which the spirit of Antichrist will enter post-recovery |
| Antichrist manifested | Antichrist will demand to be worshipped. Marks the beginning of the Great Tribulation. |
 
### Hidden Coming

| Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Firstfruit rapture | Overcomers still alive are raptured before the great tribulation. |

### Great Tribulation

| Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Martyrs produced | Many believers are slain for not worshiping Antichrist (Rev. 6:9-11; 20:4) |

### Open Coming

Christ returns visibly and ends the Tribulation, defeating Satan and Antichrist (Rev. 19:11–21).

| Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Remaining believers raptured | At the end of Tribulation, remaining living believers are caught up (Rev. 14:14–16; 1 Thes. 4:17) |
| Remaining Gentiles judged | Unbelieving gentiles are separated as "sheep" or "goats" depending on whether or not they helped believers who were persecuted (Matt. 25:31-46). |
| Remaining Jews purified | Surviving Israel is purified; every Jew living on the earth will believe (Zech. 13:8-9) |
| Satan bound | Cast into the abyss for 1,000 years (Rev. 20:1–3) |

### Millenial Kingdom

This is also called the "dispensation of righteousness." During this period, the overcomers reign with Christ over the unregenerated sheep and remnant of Israel in the old heaven and old earth for 1000 years in a heavenly administration centered in old Jerusalem. Believers who did not overcome are perfected somewhere else for 1000 years. Israel will serve God as priests to teach the nations.

| Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Overcomers reign with Christ | The kingdom reward for those who overcame in the age of grace is to reign with Christ for 1000 years (Rev. 20:4; Isa. 11). |
| Sheep nations are shepherded | Live on earth as mortals, under Christ’s rule (Matt. 25:34; Zech. 14:16). They are taught by Israel and the reigning overcomers (Isa 2:2-4). |
| Israel restored | Saved Jewish remnant becomes central on earth. The center of God's earthly administration at this point is Jerusalem (Zech. 12:10; Ezek. 36–37). |
| Children born | Mortal humans (sheep, Israel) continue to reproduce (Isa. 65:20–25) |

### Great White Throne Judgment

After the millennium and a brief rebellion led by Satan, Christ executes the final judgment on all unbelievers. This judgment is not for believers (John 5:24), but for the dead whose names are not written in the book of life. The judgment is righteous, detailed, and based on both a person’s works and their relationship to the Lamb’s book of life (Rev. 20:11–15).

| Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Satan cast into lake of fire | After a short release and final deception of the nations, Satan is thrown into the lake of fire forever (Rev. 20:7–10). |
| Resurrection of the dead | All the dead who were not part of the first resurrection are raised to stand before the throne (Rev. 20:5, 12). |
| Two scrolls opened | The first scroll records each person’s works. They are judged according to these, determining the degree of punishment (Rev. 20:12; Rom. 2:5–6; Luke 12:47–48). |
| Book of life opened | If a person’s name is not found in the book of life, they are cast into the lake of fire. This is the final separation from God (Rev. 20:15). |
| Degrees of punishment | Though all unbelievers go to the lake of fire, the intensity of punishment varies according to their works and light received (Luke 12:47–48; Matt. 11:22–24). |

## Indicators

The below list of indicators for the Lord's imminent coming are all theoretical and may not actually be true:

| Indicator | Description |
| Testimony in Europe | Europe is the seat of the administration of the Antichrist. Before the Lord comes back, He must have a testimony in the land where the Antichrist rules. |
| Age gets darker | As in the days of Noah, the outward environment becomes degraded to the extent that the saints have no choice but to pray for the Lord to come quickly. |
| Growth of the church in Rome | The church in Rome, where the Roman Catholic church is overwhelmingly dominant, grows to a sizeable number of saints (150-200+). |
