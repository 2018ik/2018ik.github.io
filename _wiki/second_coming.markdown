## Background

The Lord's **second coming** refers to His coming back at the close of the dispensation of grace.

In order for the Lord to come back, His bride needs to be made ready, which is the built up Body of Christ. This can only occur if believers corporately partake of the Lord's unsearchable riches to be His fullness. The Lord is not going to come back on some arbitrary date, the believers are able to hasten His return (1 Pet. 3:12).

## Significance

The world is hopeless, and all things defiled by the rebellion of Satan are to be dissolved. With this in view, each believer should consider that their living determines what they will be in the coming age (2 Pet. 3:11-12).

## Timeline 

In the last days men will be lovers of self, lovers of money (Matt 24:37-39). In the present day, we even worship celebrities as idols. Morality has been slowly undermined and degraded that even our leaders who are supposed to be the pinnacle of such things are immoral. In God's economy it is the opposite - it doesn't matter what you can do or what you're good at - the person is what matters.

### Europe

Ten kingdoms, presumably in Europe, will join together under the Antichrist, who will be the last Caesar of the revived Roman Empire (Rev. 17:12). These are typified by the ten toes of the great human image in Daniel chapter 2.

### Hidden coming

Christ first comes in a hidden way, *parousia*. All the  overcoming believers still alive on earth during the second coming will be raptured to the air prior to the three and a half year great tribulation as the firstfruits to God and to the Lamb (Rev. 3:10; 14:1,14-6). However, the highest incentive for us to be the firstfruits is to satisfy God, not to escape tribulation. Then eventually, all the graves will open, and all will resurrect. 

### Great Tribulation

In the last three and a half years, Christ and the bridal army will be descending from the heavens in a hidden way.
