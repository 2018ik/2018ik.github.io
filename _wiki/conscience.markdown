## Background

The **conscience** enables one to discern right from wrong and is one of the three parts of the human spirit. It is the only part of the spirit that was not altogether deadened by the fall of man; even unbelievers have a conscience which allows them to discern good and evil. For regenerated believers, the conscience additionally functions as the window of the spirit to lead them back to God's direct heavenly ruling. If the conscience is unclean, then the light from the spirit cannot come through the window into the soul. When this window is dirtied meaning that one's heart is not turned toward God, the conscience convicts accordingly.

## Significance

The conscience is the leading part of the human spirit, and without [dealing with a dirtied conscience](../dealing_with_conscience), there is no fellowship with God (1 John 1:6). If one feels that there is a barrier between them and God, they must confess what their conscience accuses them of. 

## Origin

The conscience of man came with the spirit of man at the same time of creation. However, only after the fall of man did the conscience begin to function. Prior to the fall, man was not ashamed of his nakedness, indicating that there was no concept of good and evil, which is the primary function of the conscience. Only after eating the tree which gave them knowledge of good and evil did the conscience begin to function. In [Dispensationalism](../dispensation), this would represent the shift from the dispensation of innocence to conscience.

## Biblical Basis

The conscience is clearly a thing that exists (Acts 23:1; 24:16; 1 Tim. 1:5; 19; Heb. 9:14; 10:22; 2 Cor. 1:12). Specifically, it is a part or function of the human spirit:

1. Romans 9:1 states "My conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit." We know the Holy Spirit witnesses with our human spirit, which allows our conscience to witness in the Holy Spirit, in our conscience. 
2. In 1 Corinthians 5:3 the apostle Paul says that in his spirit he judged a sinful person. To judge means either to condemn or to justify, which are acts of the conscience. This confirms that the condemning or justifying function is in the spirit; hence, the conscience is in the spirit. 
3. Psalm 51:10 speaks of "a right spirit within me" and Psalm 34:18 speaks of being "contrite in spirit." Knowing right from wrong is related to the conscience.
4. Deuteronomy 2:30 shows that man can harden his spirit, which means that the conscience was hardened. When we cast off the feeling in the conscience, we become hardened in the spirit.

## Function

The conscience touches any offense one may have towards God and man (Acts 24:16). The function of the conscience was not manifested until the fall of man, which caused their eyes to be opened (Gen. 3:7). The most obvious feeling of the conscience is the one toward sin - for example if a believer steals something, their conscience will convict them. Then, there is a feeling towards worldly occupation. To love the world more than God, such as money or fashion, will cause the conscience to condemn. There are also feelings that don't fit in any category; for example, the conscience may convict someone to clean up their disorganized closet.  

The conscience touches situations where one may not necessarily be fully in the wrong. Just because someone else is also in the wrong, this does **not** justify oneself being in the wrong. For example, if Bob steals a $10 pen from Mike, who stole a $20000 car from Bob, Bob nonetheless still must confess fault to Mike.

## Descriptors of the Conscience

There are 15 descriptors attached to the conscience in the New Testament:

1. Good (Acts 23:1)
2. Pure (1 Tim. 3:9; 2 Tim. 1:3)
3. Purified (Heb 9:14)
4. Sprinkled (Heb. 10:22)
5. Evil (Heb. 10:22)
6. Testifying (2 Cor 1:12)
7. without offense (Acts 24:16)
8. Accusing (Rom. 2:15)
9. Excusing (Rom. 2:15)
10. Witnessing (Rom. 9:1; Rom. 8:16)
11. Branded (1 Tim. 4:2)
12. Without feeling (Eph. 4:19)
13. Defiled  (Titus 1:15)
14. Weak (1 Cor. 8:7,10,12)
15. Other people's (2 Cor. 4:2; 2 Cor. 5:11-12)

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>Once there was a brother who lost his temper in a really bad way. Afterwards, he went to the table meeting and partook of the table, and all the other brothers noticed. I asked Brother Lee, since he has trained us that if we have a disagreement with our wife, we better clear that up and apologize. Here is the secret to a happy marriage life: "Forgive me, I'm sorry." If you have a disagreement with your wife and you come to the Lord's table and you haven't apologized, don't take that table until you apologize.
>
>I love it when I'm at the Lord's table and I see a row of brothers here and there, and sometimes I'll see a brother from over here get up and go over to someone else while the table is going on. I can't hear the words, but I can tell one is apologizing to the other. It's a serious thing to take those elements, you can't take those elements in a state of division.
>
>So I asked Brother Lee, "You've trained us this way, and I can't understand how this brother could take the table after he lost his temper so bad. He's been in the recovery for many years." Brother Lee said, "I realize that compared to that brother's conscience and your conscience and my conscience operate in a different field from his conscience." I didn't really know what that meant, but at least he put me in the same field as him. Later I realized what he meant by that is we don't want our conscience to be in the field of right and wrong. To an unbeliever, the field of right and wrong is good, but in the church life, there is no right and wrong. You can get into an argument and you could be right, but you will be dead. Our conscience should be governed by life and death - do I have the Lord's presence, or have I lost the Lord's presence? If I'm full of death, I need to repent, I need to turn. So the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.
>
>The word repent means to have a change of mind, so to repent is to turn away from everything other than God to God himself. To repent is not just for your initial salvation. If you look at the book of Revelation, he tells five out of seven churches to repent, except Smyrna and Philadelphia. We all need to repent, we need to repent right now.
