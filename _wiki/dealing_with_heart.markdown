## Background

As the heart is the gateway to one's being, it is necessary to deal with the heart in order to have fellowship with God and to have an "undefiled" spirit (2 Cor. 7:1).

## Steps

### Purification

One needs not only a clean heart, but a pure heart. Pure implies there is only one element, one goal. On the other hand, a clean heart without obvious sin can still have mixture. Even a good career, good children, a good wife, etc. are goals which can cause one's heart to be impure.

Even anatomically, when one attempts to look at two distinct objects (say, more than 90 degrees apart in one's field of view), it is difficult to focus on either one properly. The same applies when one attempts to "multitask."

Don't give Christ your expired years (i.e. after retiring), give Him your best years. Actually, give Him all your years.

### Confess

After one is pure in heart, the function of the conscience becomes very clean and alert. One must then deal with the conscience by confessing to God and reconciling before men any offenses sensed by the conscience (Acts 24:16).

### Fellowship, Intuition

When one deals with their conscience, fellowship with God is restored (1 John 1:6), which will likewise restore the function of the intuition.
