## Background

**Local church administration** refers to the practical administration of the local church. 

## Offices

The the local church there are two offices: elders (overseers) and deacons (serving ones). These offices are **not** for hierarchy, but to practically lead, shepherd and teach.

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>We are now more clear on the purposes of the two offices in the local church. There is no complex hierarchy as in Roman Catholicism or today's corporations. Elders and deacons are not here to annul the functions of the other members, nor to lord it over the members so as to create a hierarchy. In Acts 20:28 and 1 Peter 5:2, the elders are told to shepherd the church of God and the flock of God. God has allotted the church to the elders for their temporary care in the present age. However, eternally the church is God's possession. The elders and deacons have no ground to exercise their personal authority over the church. The function of all the members, such as the overseeing and serving functions, are needed for the church to be built up.
