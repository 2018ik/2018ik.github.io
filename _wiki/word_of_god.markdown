## Background

The **Word of God** can refer to the Bible, the written word of God, the present speaking of God, or God Himself. Christ is called the Word of God (John 1:1). Furthermore, the word of God is the breathing out of God (2 Tim. 3:16). As the Word of God, He is the definition, explanation and expression of God. Just like how someone's speaking allows us to evaluate his person, the Word of God allows us to see who God is.

If we read this book in the proper way, the primary character (the first and last name mentioned in the New Testament is Jesus Christ) of book will live in the person who reads it. The reading of the physical book with an exercised spirit will result in the living person imparted into the reader.

When properly handled, the word of God issues in teaching, conviction, correction and instruction in righteousness (2 Tim. 3:16). Notice correction comes after conviction; a person can only be truly corrected when they are convicted of their shortcomings. Likewise conviction only comes after receiving revelation and light from the teaching of the word.


## How To Read

If we read the Bible and we miss the person of Christ, then we are reading without revelation. The only way we can get this revelation is through the exercise of the spirit; we can pray over the word of God. In this way, the Bible will bring us to the reality which is Christ.

In John 1, we see five great things: creation, incarnation, redemption, transformation and building. 

### Relation to the Spirit

Christ is the reality and the light (John 1:4; 6), however it is through the Spirit of reality that all of these things are made real to us. Christ is the embodiment of god while the Spirit is the realization of all the things which are in Christ.

### The Book Reveals the Person

In John 5 we see that the Pharisees search the scriptures and are unable to find the Son in it. Then in John 6, we see that the words which the Lord speaks are Spirit and life. However, the word at this point is merely the Old Testament; yet, it is Spirit and life, and reveals God. 

If we approach the scriptures in the right way, that is with an exercised spirit through the Spirit of reality, we get a real living person. If we approach the scriptures in the wrong way, we separate the person from the book. We lose the person and we abuse the book. 

### Not About Knowing "Things"

The Bible is truth. In our concept, truth is often related to something that is factual, that is correct. But in scripture, truth is a person, and is what Christ is: his person, work and being. We should not limit our experience of the Bible to just the understanding of the facts, but to receive this "true" truth.

## God's Move

The Word of God issues in all of God's move. By touching the person in the word, we allow this person to live, move and operate in us.
