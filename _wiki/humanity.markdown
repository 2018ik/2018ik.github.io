## Background

**Humanity** refers to a person's human life, that is their physical body and soul. Regenerated believers possess both the divine, incorruptible life (1 Pet. 1:23; 1 John 5:11-12) and the human life. To have a proper humanity is the expression of the humanity of Jesus (Phil. 1:20). The divine life cannot stand by itself, and must be supported by a proper humanity. 

## Without God

Many countries have philosophies which study humanity. Some of these religions are fairly close to the Bible with regards to ethics. For example, Confucianism promotes the development of the "bright virtue" which is that source of one's goodness, a function of the conscience. However, there is no outside power or life involved here. Man was made a vessel to contain God; to eschew God from the picture is like pushing a car with one's hands instead of filling it with gasoline and starting the engine.

## Proper Humanity

Gaining the proper humanity is a matter of growth in life:

1. Call on the name of the Lord out of a pure heart (2 Tim. 2:22)
2. Breathe in every word of the scriptures (2 Tim. 3:16)
3. Live the corporate, Body life (2 Tim. 2:22)
4. Exercise the mingled spirit, which all believers have (2 Tim. 1:7; 4:22)

As a result, we express the highest virtues:

1. Extraordinary love: a love to the extent where one loves their enemies (Mat. 5:44).
2. Boundless forbearance: to be forgiving, reasonable, considerate and suitable in every situation (Luke 23:34).
3. Unparalleled faithfulness: to never betray anyone or the Lord.
4. Absolute humanity: to be humbled and to be in humiliation, made small in the eyes of others.
5. Utmost purity: Clean and pure
6. Supreme holiness and righteousness: to be fully separated from what is common and to have no fault whatsoever toward man
7. Bright and uprightness: to be bright is about love, to be upright is about light. This is to be upright and forthright and not narrow-minded or suspicious. To be suspicious towards a brother or sister means that some darkness has entered us.
