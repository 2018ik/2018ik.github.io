## Background

**Humanity** refers to a person's human life, that is their physical body and soul. Regenerated believers possess both the divine, incorruptible life (1 Pet. 1:23; 1 John 5:11-12) and the human life. To have a proper humanity is to have the humanity of Jesus in the compound Spirit in the human spirit expressed through the soul. The divine life cannot stand by itself, and must be supported by a proper humanity. 

## Proper Humanity

Those who have a proper humanity:

1. Call on the name of the Lord out of a pure heart (2 Tim. 2:22)
2. Breathe in every word of the scriptures (2 Tim. 3:16)
3. Live the corporate, Body life (2 Tim. 2:22)
4. Exercise the mingled spirit, which all believers have (2 Tim. 1:7; 4:22)
