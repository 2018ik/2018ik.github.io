## Background

The Lord's **presence** is Him being with His people in order to lead them and give them rest (Exo. 33:14). This presence was physical in the OT and, but in the NT it is spiritual. However, the Lord's presence is still an OT principle and is not mentioned as a practice in the NT. Surely we need the Lord's presence, just as we need to love Him. These are foundational principles for all spiritual experience (1 Cor. 2:9). However, the NT principle is to live Christ by being one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17; Gal. 5:16).

## Biblical Examples

God told Moses that His presence will go with him. This was occurred physically by day in a pillar of cloud and by night in a pillar of fire which led them 24/7. The cloud signifies the Spirit (1 Cor. 10:1-2) and the fire signifies the Word of God (Psa. 119:105; Jer. 23:29). The pillars as God's presence signifies God Himself, meaning that God comes as the Word and the Spirit to lead and guide His people such that it no longer matters whether it is night or day.

## Significance

>I remember when I rented a car with Hertz for the first time back in the day. This was when GPS first came out, and it said I would never get lost. I was driving the car following the GPS and it took me all of the place. You drive in Pittsburgh you'll get lost real easy. You use a GPS in Boston you'll be finished. When you live in Pittsburgh you give directions like so: go down there and by 3 blocks down you'll see a convenience store and then you make a right and when you turn right you'll see a big oak tree then make a left. Our GPS is God's presence. You never get lost if you have God's presence
