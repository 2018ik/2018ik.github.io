> John came to you in the way of righteousness."
\- Matt. 21:32

## Background

The kingdom of God is of righteousness (Rom. 14:17), and righteousness is the foundation of God's throne (Psa. 89:14). Therefore, the way God operates today is in righteousness. The first step in this way is seen in John's baptism, where one realizes they are good for nothing besides death and burial.

On the other hand in the Old Testament, Moses came in the way of condemnation, having a ministry of condemnation (2 Cor 3:9). These two ways are directly parallel to the Old Testament dispensation of law and the New Testament dispensation of grace. 

## Significance

Knowing that God operates according to His righteousness answers many questions which appear contrary to common sense. 

### Baptism of Jesus

Jesus was a man in the flesh (John 1:14). Although He was without sin (Rom. 8:3; Heb. 4:15), His flesh was nonetheless worthy of only death and burial. Therefore, He needed to be buried in the death water according to God's righteous requirement for all men to have this realization (Matt. 3:15). This was a declaration to the universe that He would not rely on any part of His flesh for God's ministry.
