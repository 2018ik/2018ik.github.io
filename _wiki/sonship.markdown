## Background

**Sonship** in the New Testament refers not only to believers being children of God with His life, but also includes maturity, position and right. Position and rights issue from maturity, which issues from a growth in life.

The context in which the sonship is mentioned in Galatians 4 as well as Romans 8 is in contrast to living under the law or under the flesh. Living under the law is essentially enslaving oneself (Gal. 4:1) as the law is a curse and does not issue in sonship. Only that which dispenses life can cause a person to grow in life and gain the position and right their Father's estate. Galatians 4:7 and Romans 8:13 even goes on to say that we would become joint-heirs with Christ.
