## Background

The **Seed of Abraham** is a title of Christ, as a descendent of Abraham. To be blessed with believing Abraham (Gal. 3:9) implies that the believers are added to Abraham's seed to receive the blessing of Abraham (which is the promise of the Spirit).

## Biblical Basis

The genealogies in Matthew and Luke prove that Jesus Christ was a descendant of Abraham. Therefore to be put into Christ by being baptized into the name of the Triune God is to become Abraham's seed and to receive his blessing (Gal. 3:29; Matt. 28:19).
