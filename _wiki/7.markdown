## Background

**Seven** signifies completion and intensification. The number seven appears a lot in Revelation, which details the completion of the age, as seen in the seven seals, seven trumpets, seven bowls and prophecies concerning the great tribulation of seven years. In Genesis, God created all things over a period of 6 days, and rested on the seventh after a complete week.

In Revelation, there are also the seven lamps, the seven eyes, and the seven Spirits, signifying the intensification of the Spirit.
