## Background

**Seven** signifies completion and intensification in time. The number seven appears a lot in Revelation, which details the completion of the age, as seen in the seven seals, seven trumpets, seven bowls and prophecies concerning the great tribulation of seven years. In Genesis, God created all things over a period of 6 days, and rested on the seventh after a complete week. In Revelation, there are also the seven lamps, the seven eyes, and the seven Spirits, signifying the intensification of the Spirit. These are all things which occur in time, as opposed to 12 which emphasizes completion in eternity (the number 12 appears frequently with respect to the New Jerusalem whereas 7 does not).

## Significance

Seven is composed of three plus four, meaning God is added to man. But anything that is added can also be subtracted and thus be lost again.
