## Background

God pays more attention to what kind of **person** or **character** someone lives than what they can accomplish. In a sense, in God's economy, the person *is* the work. The living of God's people should be different from the common living; this includes how one behaves in their work life, church life and family life.

## Significance

It is not enough to be competent in performing many tasks; the proper Christian living is one which lives out Christ daily, not only during the church meetings. How one conducts themselves in their daily living has a significant impact on their testimony towards their family (especially the children), friends and coworkers. Furthermore, those with a good character can be used by God to carry out many things. There is no difference between the Holy Spirit that each person receives; however, the degree to which that Spirit can penetrate one's being is a matter of character. 

## Biblical Basis

Jesus could do nothing except that which was allowed by the Father (John ??:??). 

Matthew 17:7-12 teaches that a good tree produces good fruit and that a corrupt tree produces bad fruit. A good tree inherently produces good fruit; it is the proper source which brings forth the proper results. Likewise, a proper minister will spontaneously result in a good ministry. It is senseless to try to work out a good ministry without first taking care of the person.

Abraham, Moses and Paul all had an excellent character. In Acts, the elders which were appointed were 7 well-attested men. These were reliable men of good character.

## Practical Basis

If one is able to do much (i.e. speak eloquently, have much knowledge and life experience) but has a bad character, they will be unable to be useful to the Lord. For example, new ones are always listening to the things mature ones say and do, even the small things. If the leading ones are sloppy, rude or of bad character during off-hours, what kind of testimony would that give to those observing? It would lessen the value of *all* of their words.

The Christian life is a life of sowing; everything one does is a kind of sowing, either of the flesh or the spirit (Gal. 6:7-8). That is, what one does in their daily living is also a pattern that the younger ones follow (2 Tim 3:10). A dissolute life establishes a bad standard which others - especially one's children - will follow.

### Examples

On Lord's day (Sunday), believers should go to the Lord's day meeting, because it is the proper testimony of a Christian. Nowadays, Sunday morning seems to be the only available time for things to be done - sports, birthday parties, etc. As ones who belong to God, believers must have a particular living, including during the Lord's day morning.

At work, all kinds of social events occur, but the coworkers need to realize that if there is something with the church, we are not available. Eventually, they will understand and respect such decisions, to be true to one's conviction and faith. 

## Building Character

Character building is easier the younger a person is. Children should be built up in their character so that they will be useful to the Lord when they are older.
