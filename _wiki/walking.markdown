## Background

**Walking by the Spirit**, as opposed to living by the Spirit, has the sense of carrying things out. One should learn to walk by the Spirit in small matters first, say, how one talks or dresses. Then, the large matters will be settled organically. 

## Daily Walk

The Greek word *peripateo* as in Galatians 5:16 is a habitual, daily walk.

## Orderly Walk

The Greek word *stoicheo* (στοιχέω) as in Galatians 5:25 and 6:16 is a march in military rank. 

## Significance
