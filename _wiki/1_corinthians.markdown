## Background

First Corinthians describes a realistic church life, in contrast to the ideal described in Romans 12-16. We are no better than the Corinthians, especially in terms of our inner being.

In this book, we see the spiritual, the soulish, and the fleshly. In fact, during this time to call someone a Corinthian was an insult due to their degraded condition.

Paul's intention was to solve the problems among the saints in Corinth. However for all te problems, especially divisiveness, the only solution is the enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ.

## Divisions

Corinthians talks about divisions; can any one of us say we are not divisive in the least bit?

To think that there are no problems in our church life is a *foolish* thought. Even the 12 disciples in the Gospels, the only person that could've dealt with all of them was Jesus Christ.

## Marriage Life

1 Corinthians 5?? reveals how Paul deals with marriage life. But rather than focusing on the marriage itself, he instead focuses on Christ.
