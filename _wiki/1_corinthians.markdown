## Background

First Corinthians describes a realistic church life, in contrast to the ideal described in Romans 12-16. We are no better than the Corinthians, especially in terms of our inner being.

In this book, we see the spiritual, the soulish, and the fleshly. In fact, during this time to call someone a Corinthian was an insult due to their degraded condition.

Paul's intention was to solve the problems among the saints in Corinth. However for all te problems, especially divisiveness, the only solution is the enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ.

## Divisions

Corinthians talks about divisions; can any one of us say we are not divisive in the least bit?

To think that there are no problems in our church life is a *foolish* thought. Even the 12 disciples in the Gospels, the only person that could've dealt with all of them was Jesus Christ.

## Marriage Life

1 Corinthians 7 reveals how Paul deals with marriage life. But rather than focusing on the marriage itself, he instead focuses on Christ.

## Chapters 

### 7

While books such as Ephesians, John and Revelation may reveal the high peak truths, this chapter of 1 Corinthians reveals someone who lives out these truths, someone who is in every respect obedient, submissive and satisfied with God. Paul was absolutely one with God, and wanted the Corinthian believers to be one with Him and not to initiate anything (1 Cor. 7:17-24).

Here, the philosophical greeks had questions and proposals regarding what should happen in married life. And the answers are seemingly to resolve the questions regarding married life. But just as in the book, he was solving the problems by showing them who he was as a person absolutely joined to Christ as one spirit.

In the Old Testament, the speaking of God was "Thus says the Lord" (Isa. 10:24; Jer. 2:2). However here, Paul is able to charge directly on behalf of God, as his opinions are of God (1 Cor. 7:10; 7:12; 7:25; 7:40). Nowhere else in the entire Bible is as high as this chapter in terms of God expressed through a man (who isn't Jesus).

In verse 25, he explicitly states that he received no commandment from the Lord, yet he is able to give his opinion. Because Paul knew God and was one with God to such an extent, he knew what the Spirit of God would like to say.
