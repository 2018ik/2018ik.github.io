## Background

In the church life opinions are much more than oldness. Oldness is terrible, but opinions are much more prevalent among humans. All humans are a constitution of opinions. The best way to show you are not opinionated is to follow the brothers.

Even if our opinion is right, we should not speak it.

## Early Church

Compare and contrast the Apollos and Barnabas, two brothers who failed to cooperate with Paul in his ministry, with Priscilla, Aquila and Timothy.

### Barnabas

Barnabas wanted to bring along Mark according to his natural preference.  Despite ushering Paul into the church and the ministry, Barnabas' opinion brought division into the church. They were divided not because of doctrine or practice, but a seemingly innocent opinion. 

### Apollos

See action regarding Apollos in [oldness](/oldness#early-church#apollos)

## Today

### To Be Settled

We shouldn't have our living and our understanding settled. For example, we shouldn't think that we have grasped any particular passage of the Bible. There is always something new and fresh you have yet to see.
