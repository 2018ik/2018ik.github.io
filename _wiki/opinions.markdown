## Background

In the church life opinions are much more than oldness. Oldness is terrible, but opinions are much more prevalent among humans. All humans are a constitution of opinions. The best way to show you are not opinionated is to follow the brothers. Even if our opinion is right, we should not speak it, as the church life is not in the business of right and wrong.

## Early Church

Compare and contrast the Apollos and Barnabas, two brothers who failed to cooperate with Paul in his ministry, with Priscilla, Aquila and Timothy.

### Barnabas

Barnabas wanted to bring along Mark according to his natural preference.  Despite ushering Paul into the church and the ministry, Barnabas' opinion brought division into the church. They were divided not because of doctrine or practice, but a seemingly innocent opinion. 

### Apollos

See action regarding Apollos in [oldness](/oldness#early-church#apollos)

## Today 

Today, there are still many opinions which divide us.

### Food

### To Be Settled

We shouldn't have our living and our understanding settled. For example, we shouldn't think that we have grasped any particular passage of the Bible. There is always something new and fresh you have yet to see.

## Opinion of God

Actually, there is one opinion that matters, and that is God's opinion, which can be expressed through us. Paul gives His opinion in 1 Corinthians 7:40, but in this case, the Spirit of God was in his opinion. Our own opinions do not matter, but we can be saturated with the life-giving Spirit to the extent that our own opinions reflect what is on God's heart.
