## Background

Luke 18:9-14 depicts two men who went up to the temple to pray: a Pharisee, and a publican (tax collector). while the Pharisee offered a self-centered prayer, the tax collector simply asked God to be propitiated to him, the sinner.

## Significance

The only way to eliminate sin is to humble oneself as a sinner before God.
