## Background

**Redeeming the time** refers to using one's time in a profitable way for the Lord's purpose. While the Lord redeems and supplies mankind in many things, the one thing a person must redeem for the Lord's interest is their time. The difference between the prudent and foolish virgins in Matthew 25:1-13 is time; some were ready when Christ (as the bridegroom) arrived, having redeemed the time by filling their vessels with oil, while others were not.

## Significance

The age of grace is nearing its end, and as such, believers should not live thinking that they are fine doing their own thing as the second coming is far off. Sixty-nine of the seventy weeks have been fulfilled, and in anticipation of the last week, all must answer the call from the Lord that these last days would count in His eyes.
