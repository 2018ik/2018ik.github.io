## Background

The **speciality, generality, and practicality** of the church life is a way to categorize church teachings for the sake of oneness. Speciality refers to the common faith in which we must be specific. Generality refers to to secondary matters that are not part of common faith in which we can be general. The basis in which we receive believers for fellowship is that God has received them.

## Speciality

The word *speciality* refers to what makes the church life special. These are items of the [faith that is common](../common_faith) to all believers. We must be specific regarding these matters and to even contend for these matters. 

## Generality

Besides the common faith mentioned in speciality, our receiving of persons for fellowship should be general. Paul in Romans 14 was someone who was very general in his church life. However, generality must be balanced as well.
