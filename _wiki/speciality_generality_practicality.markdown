## Background

The **speciality, generality, and practicality** of the church life refer to three groups of items which one should view as special, general, and practical. Speciality refers to key points of truth which believers must be very specific about. This consists of the common faith. Generality refers to [all secondary and tertiary matters](../bible#categories-of-truth) that are not part of common faith in which we can be general. 

## Speciality

The word *speciality* refers to what makes the church life special. These are items of the [faith that is common](../common_faith) to all believers. We must be specific regarding these matters and to even contend for these matters. Knowing these items allow us to recognize who are genuine believers.

## Generality

Besides the common faith mentioned in speciality, our receiving of persons for fellowship should be general. The basis in which we receive believers for fellowship is that God has received them. Furthermore, we should be general in our attitude toward others so as to not stumble them. Christians are divided today because of a lack of generality. Due to minor disagreements in truth and opinion, they choose to divide. Paul in Romans 14 was someone who was very general in his church life. He would eat only vegetables to not stumble someone who believed animals were dirty (Rom. 14:2-3). Although God ordained that all things were good to eat, this is not a point of truth one should contend over to force vegetarians to eat meat. However, generality must be balanced as well (Paul [sometimes went too far](../paul#back-to-jerusalem) in his generality).

## Practicality

The practicality of the church life are matters which contribute to life and the growth in life. 

The Lord did not say "I have come that they may have teaching" and the last-Adam did not become a gift-giving Spirit because the center of God's purpose is not these things, but life (John 10:10; 1 Cor. 15:45). Furthermore, it's easy to talk about life; what we want is the practical way to receive life and grow in life.

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

Topic: generality

>I stopped by the grocery store to get some drinks, and there's this one drink that has a lizard on its label. A sister saw that she said, "I'm not touching that, it's something related to a dragon." Yes, the dragon in the Bible is a symbol of Satan, but I just thought, "Wut, I don't see how you can make that connection." I would've had no problem, but I certainly wasn't going to touch it after hearing that comment because I wanted to take care of the sister. This would be troubling to her then I wouldn't touch it. That's the kind of attitude that we should have toward others. If we are aware of something, it's not a question of right or wrong, it's a question of whether it will stumble that person. So we need to be care of such things. We don't want to stumble the saints. So we have to take a general attitude toward miscellaneous things.
