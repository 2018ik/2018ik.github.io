## Background

Hiram is someone who learned skills in the world and used it in resurrection.

His father was a man of Tyre, so he learned all kinds of skill in bronze work. Tyre was a gentile city known for its commerce and its oneness with Satan (Ezek 28). His mother was a widow, so his father must have died. He was also transferred from the tribe of Dan to te tribe of Naphtali, the former which is of sin and idolatry, having caused the children of israel to fall into idolatry. On the other hand, the tribe of Naphtali speaks beautiful words.

## Significance

The skills which we gain by receiving a higher education need to go through death and resurrection (signified by the death of his father, transferring Hiram to the tribe of Naphtali). This is the cross must deal with out natural ability.
