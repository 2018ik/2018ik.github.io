>"After my study of the Bible for the past sixty-nine years, what have I seen? I would say that I have seen the New Jerusalem. This is my vision, this is my revelation, and this is my ministry."

\- Practical Points Concerning Blending, pp. 25-26

## Background

The **New Jerusalem** is the complete expression and enlargement of God mingled with man as the consummate issue of the church, the Body of Christ. It is not a physical city or place, but the totality of all believers as the bride of God in the millennium and the wife of God in eternity (Rev. 21:2). God in eternity stepped into time and created all things including man to obtain for Himself the New Jerusalem as a counterpart whom He will marry. As the final vision given to John, the New Jerusalem is the greatest and ultimate sign in the scriptures (Rev. 1:1). Christians often believe that they will end up in heaven, and there will be some kind of mansion, golden streets, etc. This is based on John chapters 13 and 14. However the Bible tells us that the New Jerusalem descends out of heaven, and it is much more than just a city (a bride, even). If we miss this, then we are missing a rich gospel that the Lord is showing us.

>"And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, **prepared as a bride** adorned for her husband"

\- Rev. 21:2

Everything about the New Jerusalem is in type. In Revelation 1:1 we see that Christ made His revelation known by "signs." As the Lamb is a sign for Christ, so are the lampstands signs for the local churches, so is the New Jerusalem a sign for the bride of Christ. All of the elements of its structure are also signs that point to a hidden reality. Furthermore, none of these types are not exclusive to Revelation, but developed throughout both the OT and NT. In fact, the blueprint for the New Jerusalem can be seen in the very beginning in Genesis 1-2 and at the very end in Revelation 21-22 (notice that both of these pairs of chapters are descriptions of an era where man has nothing to do with sin). In Genesis, there is man, a tree of life, the river of water of life, and many precious materials. In Revelation, all of these things still exist, except there is no mention of man, because man has become a corporate city: the New Jerusalem.

## Titles

### Holy City

The New Jerusalem is a holy city (Rev. 21:2), which means that according to the NT definition of holy it is saturated with God, not merely separated unto God. A physical building cannot be saturated with God, meaning that whatever the "holy city" is must be something created in God's image that can contain God (mankind). 

### City of the Living God

Hebrews 12:22 says that we have "come forward to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem." This is because the reality of the New Jerusalem to day is the church. Even today, we are partakers of a heavenly calling (Heb. 3:1) who have tasted the heavenly gift (Heb. 6:4). We see in chapter 11 that this city has God as its Architect and Builder. It would be absurd for the organic masterpiece of God that is the church (Eph. 2:10) to be a mere physical city. To say otherwise is to depreciate God's  wisdom as the eternal Architect and Builder. When we come to the church today, we experience a foretaste of the heavenly New Jerusalem.

### Tabernacle of God

### Wife of the Lamb

### Mother of the Believers


Our living out of the New Jerusalem is for us to become the New Jerusalem, and our working out the New Jerusalem is for us to build the New Jerusalem by the flowing Triune God.

The New Jerusalem is for the glorification of the Triune God as the oneness of the believers built into the Triune God (John 17). John 17 reveals the divine incorporation of God and man, and that the firstborn Son and the Sons of God might be glorified. John likely wrote his gospel after he had seen the vision. The fulfillment of this prayer is consummated in the New Jerusalem.

## Typology

The clearest picture of the New Jerusalem in the Pentateuch is found in Numbers: there was a tabernacle in the center of the encampment, and the children of Israel were divided into four groups of three and positioned around the tabernacle. These three tribes on each side is parallel to the three gates of the New Jerusalem on its four sides.

In John 17, the Lord Jesus prayed that the Son would be glorified, and that the believers would be one as the Father and the Son are one (John 17:21-23). The fulfillment of this prayer can only be the New Jerusalem: the organic composition of God with man.

This is not a physical and lifeless city made of literal, physical stones - we are **becoming** the New Jerusalem, the bride of Christ, through which man is joined to God in marriage. Genesis 1-2 is the organic blueprint, the architectural plan of the Triune God, and Revelation 21-22 reveals the finished product, the organic masterpiece of the Triune God. The New Jerusalem promised to the overcomers in Revelation 3:12 is a prize only to the overcomers during the millennium, whereas the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth is the common portion of all the redeemed for eternity.

## Description

The New Jerusalem has one throne with one flow of life, one tree of life, and one street of life. 

### Throne

The throne of God and of the lamb is for divine administration. It is the source of eternal enjoyment since the river flows out of the throne. The fact that the throne is of both God and the Lamb indicates the divine incorporation of the Trinity.

### River

The river of water of life flowing out of the throne proceeding in the middle of the street signifies divine life as the Spirit for the believers' supply and satisfaction. The flow of life makes all the believers match who is on the throne; in a sense, the New Jerusalem is produced by what is coming out of the throne.

### Tree of Life

The tree of life typifying Christ grows on two sides of the river and yields fruit each month. The tree is Christ as the true vine, as only a vine tree can grow on both sides of a river. The tree's location along the river indicates that wherever the Spirit is, there is Christ. 

### Street

The street of gold signifies divine and human communications, as it proceeds from the throne to reach all twelve gates of the city. This brings the entire city into submission to the one divine administration. Given that a single street reaches every gate, this street as well as the river which runs alongside it could may spiral down from the throne of God at the top.

### Mountain

The New Jerusalem is 12000 stadia tall, about 1300 miles, yet its walls are only 144 cubits. Furthermore, it is pure gold (Rev. 21:18). This indicates that the city itself may be a mountain.

### Wall

There is a great and high wall with twelve gates, with three gates in each cardinal direction. The wall signifies separation and protection while the gates signify communication and entrance. Some believers and churches have a very strong wall, but with no gates, so there is no way for people to enter in. This is to be sectarian and exclusive. 

The gates in four direction means that no matter where someone is coming from and what their background is, there must be a way for them to enter into the church. The Lord's charge is to disciple *all* the nations (Matt. 28:19). The three gates on each side signifies the Triune God working to bring people into the church.
