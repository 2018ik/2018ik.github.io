>"After my study of the Bible for the past sixty-nine years, what have I seen? I would say that I have seen the New Jerusalem. This is my vision, this is my revelation, and this is my ministry."

\- Practical Points Concerning Blending, pp. 25-26

## Background

The **New Jerusalem** is the complete expression and enlargement of the processed Triune God mingled with the believers. It is not a physical city or place, but the bride of God in eternity (Rev. 21:2). As the final vision given to John, the New Jerusalem is the greatest and ultimate sign in the scriptures (Rev. 1:1).

Christians often believe that they will end up in heaven, and there will be some kind of mansion, golden streets, etc. Similarly, we may have certain concepts regarding the New Jerusalem. But the Bible tells us that the New Jerusalem is a lot more than just a city. If we miss this, then we are missing a rich gospel that the Lord is showing us.

Our living out of the New Jerusalem is for us to become the New Jerusalem, and our working out the New Jerusalem is for us to build the New Jerusalem by the flowing Triune God.

The New Jerusalem is for the glorification of the Triune God as the oneness of the believers built into the Triune God (John 17). John 17 reveals the divine incorporation of God and man, and that the firstborn Son and the Sons of God might be glorified. John likely wrote his gospel after he had seen the vision. The fulfillment of this prayer is consummated in the New Jerusalem.

## Biblical Basis

The blueprint for the New Jerusalem can be seen in the very beginning in Genesis 1-2. 

The clearest picture of the New Jerusalem in the Pentateuch is found in Numbers: there was a tabernacle in the center of the encampment, and the children of Israel were divided into four groups of three and positioned around the tabernacle. These three tribes on each side is parallel to the twelve gates of the New Jerusalem with three gates on four sides.

In John 17, the Lord Jesus prayed that the Son would be glorified, and that the believers would be one as the Father and the Son are one (John 17:21-23). The fulfillment of this prayer can only be the New Jerusalem: the organic composition of God with man.

In Revelation 1:1 we see that Christ made His revelation known by signs. As the Lamb is a sign for Christ, so are the lampstands signs for the local churches, so is the New Jerusalem a sign for the bridge of Christ, which is the consummation of the Body of Christ, which is the totality of the believers.

>"And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, **prepared as a bride** adorned for her husband"

\- Rev. 21:2

This is not a physical and lifeless city made of literal, physical stones - we are **becoming** the New Jerusalem, the bride of Christ, through which we will be joined to God in oneness

Genesis 1-2 is the organic blueprint, the architectural plan of the Triune God, and Revelation 21-22 reveals the finished product, the organic masterpiece of the Triune God.

The New Jerusalem promised to the overcomers in Revelation 3:12 is a prize only to the overcomers during the millennium, whereas the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth is the common portion of all the redeemed for eternity.

## Description

The New Jerusalem has one throne with one flow of life, one tree of life, and one street of life. 

### River

The river of water of life flowing out of the throne proceeding in the middle of the street signifies divine life as the Spirit for the believers' supply and satisfaction. The tree of life typifies Christ, and is available along the flow of the river. This indicates that wherever the Spirit is, there is Christ.

### Street

The street of gold signifies divine and human communications, as it proceeds from the throne to reach all twelve gates of the city. This brings the entire city into submission to the one divine administration. Given that a single street reaches every gate, this street as well as the river which runs alongside it could may spiral down from the throne of God at the top.

### Mountain

The New Jerusalem is 12000 stadia tall, about 1300 miles, yet its walls are only 144 cubits. Furthermore, it is pure gold (Rev. 21:18). This indicates that the city itself may be a mountain.

## Central Line

God's eternal intention for us to become the New Jerusalem is seen in Genesis 1-2 as the organic blueprint and in Revelation 21-22 as the finished product, the organic masterpiece of the Triune God. 

First, we can establish that man is a vessel created according to God's plan that we may contain and express Him. The tree of life in Genesis represents Christ Himself as life for us to eat; this tree extends also to Revelation. Likewise we see a river of water of life flowing to reach the four directions of the earth; in this flow are three precious materials for God's building. The goal is the producing of a couple, a corporate great God-man.

## Application

Everything that we do, everything that we say - is it for the building?
