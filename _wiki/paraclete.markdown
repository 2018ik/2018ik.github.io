## Background

**Paraclete**, the Greek word for advocate, denotes the role of Christ in the heavens as the intercessor and counselor for those who confess their sins. If anyone sins, they have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous (1 John 2:1). When one is faithful and righteous to confess (1 John 1:9), Christ with His redemption and righteousness as the basis guarantees that their sins will be forgiven by the Father. Furthermore, He also continues to comfort and guide the believers as the wonderful Counselor (Isa. 9:6).

When Satan accuses, he must answer to Christ as the paraclete and heavenly attorney, who will drop all the accusations on the basis of the blood. 
The Father looks not at the sinner's shortcomings, but the blood of Christ.
