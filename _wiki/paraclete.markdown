## Background

**Paraclete**, the Greek word for advocate, denotes the role of Christ in the heavens as the intercessor and counselor for those who confess their sins. When one is faithful and righteous to confess, Christ with His redemption and righteousness as the basis guarantees that their sins will be forgiven by the Father. Furthermore, He also continues to comfort and guide the believers as the wonderful Counselor (Isa. 9:6).
