## Background

The **exhibition** of Christ refers to the fact that the corporate worship of Christ in the meetings is a time for each believer to present and exhibit what they have experienced and enjoyed of Christ in their daily life. In order for the meetings to be an exhibition of Christ to God, a daily living in Christ to have a surplus of Christ is required. This genuine worship of God must be recovered in order for the Bride to make herself ready for the Lord's coming.
