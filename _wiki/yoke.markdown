## Background

The **yoke** of the Lord in Matthew 11:29-30 is the will of the Father. Such is a yoke is easy, not bitter and the burden to carry out this will is light, not heavy (Mal. 3:14). When we touch God's will, we touch something sweet, energizing and supplying. To take the yoke is therefore to be spiritually yoked by God's will. Because this yoke is not an outward imitation by self effort, it is easy and light.
