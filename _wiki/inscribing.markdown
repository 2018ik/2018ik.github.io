## Background

**Inscribing** is the process by which a believer is made a living letter by the ink of the Spirit that is the reality of Christ, the spiritual alpha, omega, and all the in-between letters. The letters Paul is speaking of in 2 Corinthians 3 are not physical letters, but saints inscribed with Christ.
