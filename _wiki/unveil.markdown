## Background

To be **unveiled** is have one's heart turned to God and to behold the Lord face to face (2 Cor. 3:16). In a sense, a turned-away heart *is* the veil.

In message 3 of the 1994 Thanksgiving Conference Brother Lee gave a very particular opening word regarding the need to be unveiled. As Lee was giving this message, and especially as the saints were giving a marvelous response, it was apparent that prior to the giving of this message, the majority of the saints in the Lord's recovery were veiled regarding the instrinsic significance of Christ's resurrection. We can listen to the same words over and over again, but once the veil is lifted, the impact is drastically different. Brother Lee said if we see a point of truth in a very general way, we would feel as if we had never seen it before. I hope we can have this sensation throughout these points which seem familiar to us.

If we were to ask an ordinary Christian what is the signifcance of Christ's death? The majority of them would say the Lord Jesus died for my sins. This is true, but it is superficial. Such a shallow notion of the death of Christ on the one hand helps human beings be saved, but it hinders them from going on in their christian life because they don't see the instrinsic significance. The Lord Jesus died on the cross and even the roman soldiers who were eye witnesses may have been able to write an account that during the second half, darkness fell over the whole land. And then when he expired, the tombs were opened. These are just outward events associated with the Lord's death, but eventually, Paul received the inrtinsic revelation regarding the spiritual significance. Our old man has be crucified with Christ. Then in colossians paul also tells us that while the Lord was dying on the cross, there was warfare between evil powers and God the father stripped them off.

In Hebrews 2:14 we are told the Lord Jesus defeated the devil through His death. John 12:24 reveals that the Lord's death revealed the divine life. Seeing these has such great impact on our Christian life. Now His death becomes relevant and applicable to daily life. 

Similarly, we need to realize that the vast majority have a superficial understanding of Christ's resurrection. 

## Tips

1. Turn the heart to the Lord. Whenever the heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away (2 Cor. 3:16). One needs to pray morning by morning that their heart may be turned to the Lord. Turning to the Lord however requires that we be saved from pride. 
2. Be saved from pride. God resists the proud.
3. Consider ourselves in a sober-minded way
4. Bind the blinding work of the god of this age
5. Receive the new covenant ministry continually
