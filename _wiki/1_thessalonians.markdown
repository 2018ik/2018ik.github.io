## Background

Paul's epistle to the church in Thessalonica was written after his short stay in the city.

## ???

Paul's gospel to the Thessalonians was in the Holy Spirit (1 Thes. 1:5). Words that are spoken not out of the Holy Spirit cannot be considered the true gospel. Furthermore, this gospel was also expressed in their living, as their living became a pattern to the saints (1 Thes. 1:6-7). If one speaks and lives without the Spirit, it is in vain. However, when the spirit is exercised, one can have assurance that what they say and do is not in vain.
