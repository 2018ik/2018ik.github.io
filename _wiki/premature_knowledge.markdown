## Background

**Premature knowledge** is knowledge that a child can logically understand to an extent, but cannot yet experience. As a result, upon hearing the same fact later on, they do not appreciate it with sufficient gravity. Children's hearing can become dull if they hear too many Bible stories and spiritual truths too early; their mindset may be that they've already heard a truth and know it, without ever entering into a deeper spiritual experience.

## Biblical Basis

The wisdom and grace manifest in Jesus increased as He grew physically (Luke 2:40); children may be able to comprehend a particular truth, but be unable to realize the deeper experience as they lack spiritual wisdom.
