## Background

The **Lord's Recovery** is a recovery of the following three items in God's New Testament economy:

1. Christ as everything to the believers
2. The function of all the members of the Body
3. The oneness of the Body

This is to recover the subjective experience of Christ as life in a practical way, that the Body of Christ may be built up so the Lord can return. Satan wants to bring in replacements for Christ, rob each member of their function, and divide the members of the Body.


## Recovered Items

### Functioning of Each Member

The greatest recovery by the Lord today is the entire Body serving as priests. All saved ones should rise up to serve in the corporate priesthood (1 Pet. 2:9). Although a small group of capable ones can accomplish a lot, it is not about the work but the person. If the majority do not function, they cannot be built up and grow in life.

### The life-giving Spirit

>"The last Adam became the life-giving Spirit"

\- 1 Cor 15:45b

Christ becoming the Spirit is no doubt one of the most significant, if not the most significant, truth which was recovered in the 20th century. Without experiencing Christ as the life-giving Spirit, everything of Christ's person remains objective doctrine.
