## Background

The **Lord's Recovery** is a recovery of the following three items in God's New Testament economy:

1. Christ as everything to the believers
2. The oneness of the Body of Christ
3. The function of all the members of the Body

The first point is a matter of experiencing Christ, and the second and third points are related to the proper practice of the church life. In short, the Lord's Recovery is the recovery of Christ and the church. The concept of experiencing or enjoying Christ is largely lost in Christianity, and the practice of the church life is completely ignored. Over the centuries, Satan brought in many replacements for Christ, robbed each member of their function, and divided the members of the Body. These satanic replacements include the clergy-laity system and many "Christian" traditions. The Lord's recovery is for recovering the subjective experience of Christ as life in a practical way, that the Body of Christ may be built up so the Lord can return.

The Lord's Recovery is not about following a person, but to follow the all-inclusive, all-inheriting vision of the age.

## "Recovery"

*Recovery* means to restore or return something to a normal condition after damage or loss has been incurred. In a sense, this is to go back to the beginning before the damage was done. The church has been degraded through many centuries of its history, and needs to be restored to God's original intention. This includes the introduction of human philosophy, as in the Colossians (Col. 2:8; 1:12), Judaism as in the Galatians and Hebrews (Heb. 8:6; Gal. 3:1-3), and gifts, signs and wisdoms as in Corinth (1 Cor. 1:22-23). Satan is also working to divide the Body of Christ with sects and denominations (1 Cor. 1:10-13; Gal. 5:19-20) as well as the clergy-laity system which kills the function of each member (Rev. 2:6; 1:5-6; 1 Pet. 2:5,9).


## Recovered Items

### Functioning of Each Member

The greatest recovery by the Lord today is the entire Body serving as priests. All saved ones should rise up to serve in the corporate priesthood (1 Pet. 2:9). Although a small group of capable ones can accomplish a lot, it is not about the work but the person. If the majority do not function, they cannot be built up and grow in life.

### The life-giving Spirit

>"The last Adam became the life-giving Spirit"

\- 1 Cor 15:45b

Christ becoming the Spirit is no doubt one of the most significant, if not the most significant, truth which was recovered in the 20th century. Without experiencing Christ as the life-giving Spirit, everything of Christ's person remains objective doctrine.
