## Background

**Body consciousness** is the sense in which an individual realizes that they are in the Body of Christ, that is, all their capacity, situations and living is wholly a corporate matter of the Body of Christ, and not of themselves as an individual. 

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>About twenty years ago, every Lord's day for dinner in the evening my wife and I would have all the fourth-term trainees. There would be about a hundred of them to come in large groups, about fifteen, to come. Every Lord's day, my wife is laboring on this, and I had the strange feeling, so I said "Dear, I have the feeling no one is coming." And they didn't come. And we were not bothered. I said, "What I'm going to do is take all of this delightful food and take it to where the brothers are living." But then eventually, the trainees found out that they didn't let us know ahead of time. They sent an email and that said they know the Body that well. So in the class a few days after that, I didn't condemn or criticize anyone. I simply said, "Actually, you don't know the Body at all. And that is normal where you are in the growth of life."

>This is God's goal in this age; before the bride can make herself ready and before the one new man corporately can be manifested, the Body needs to be built up organically. This is a crucial matter that while I'm sharing this with you the Lord is interceding with His prayer and while I'm speaking the prayer is rising up that in the relatively near future you will have Body consciousness. Now please don't examine yourself if I ask you what kind of consciousness do you have, what are you conscious of? In all of us at a certain stage it is merely what is our situation. But the time will come when we realize experientially that you are a living member of the Body and the result will be you are Body conscious. But all over the earth whether it's coworkers or leading brothers if they are not Body conscious they will make all kinds of decisions that are sincere, honest and accurate but it is quite different if the decision is made with Body consciousness.

>So I'm referring again to July 2022, when I was in severe pain about something and I had to be taken to the ER. And then after they did the tests they examined my heart again and this cardiologist who was taking care of me said, "The stents will not work anymore you need open heart surgery." And there was just peace, but then I realized this is a Body matter. It's not just a personal matter. This is why I contacted the brothers that I couldn't give the remaining messages due to this surgery. And they prayed because this is a Body matter. Whether or not we are prepared to be rapture ready to be part of the bride who has made herself ready, we all have to become Body conscious. This means me in my present situation humanly is not the center and is not the goal. I'm a member of the Body experiencing this and I need the Body's life supply, prayer and also the Body will benefit from whatever the Lord gains in me.

>This is something that will take place within you, but it's in my heart that within the next 8-10 years you will have passed through the third stage of the experience of life, the cross applying to the flesh, the self and the natural constitution. You're just not holding back, you just realize that goal. I want to reach the goal. If someone really knows the Body, they realize on the one hand that they cannot live apart from the Body. They;re a member attached to it. But also they can discern whether or not this or that saint knows the Body. Brothers in particular, you don't want to be in a situation where you can say, "I know." You know, objectively but you don't know experientially. There's a loving concern in my heart that you're willing to follow the Lord's leading that in the rather near future you will be Body conscious and from that point on every day of your life will contribute to the Body building itself up in love.
