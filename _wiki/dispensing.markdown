## Background

The divine **dispensing** of the Trinity refers to the addition of God's life into the three parts of man. Such as dispensing can also be described as God "working Himself into us." This dispensing is not a massive outward force which can be visibly felt, but it is normal, gentle, calm and out of faith, not feeling. 

The issuing of the divine dispensing is the rivers of living water flowing out of one's innermost being (John 7:37-38). The second issue is fruit-bearing; the divine life flows out as fruit (John 15:5), that is, the divine life flows to others to bring forth fruit.

## Biblical Basis

The Spirit of God dwells with the spirit of man (Rom. 8:9, 16), and is a Spirit of life which gives life to the spirit, soul and body (Rom. 8:6, 10-11).
