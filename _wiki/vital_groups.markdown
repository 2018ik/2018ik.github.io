## Background

A vital groups is a group of normal Christians who will bring in a new age.

The church is degraded, and has become abnormal, even since the early church throughout Paul's epistles. Satan's strategy is to bring in many replacements for Christ; instead of Christ himself, believers are often more interested in Bible knowledge, carrying out good works, and trying to do good things.

The enemy has also annulled the function of the members of the Body of Christ. Instead of all the members functioning as priests to God, there are intermediate members (e.g. clergy) through which the members communicate to God by proxy. 

Lastly, the enemy has brought in division, which is quite apparent today with the many denominations of Christianity.

All of these aforementioned things are *not* normal - therefore to be an overcomer actually requires simply being a normal Christian: no replacements for Christ, direct contact with God, and to have the proper oneness. A vital group is a group composed of such normal Christians.

## Why "Vital" Groups?

To be "vital" means to be living and active. There are many groups - believers who meet together - but there is a need for groups who can steadfastly increase, perfect, and build up the Body of Christ (Acts 2:46-47). 

The nature of the vital groups is spiritual, to be filled with the Holy Spirit. The condition of the vital groups is loving one another (John 13:35) in oneness and with one accord.

If we aren't aware of what it means to be in a vital group, it is easy to gather in a natural way - socializing rather than blending.

## Acts 2:46-47

In these two verses, we see six things which vital groups do:

>"day by day"

>"continuing steadfastly with one accord"

>"breaking bread from house to house"

>"partook of their good with exultation and simplicity of heart"

>"praising God and having grace with all"

>"the Lord added together those who were being saved"

Unbelievers observe these six things and innately desire them; people want to have the kind of community that is only possible in the Body of Christ, out of the divine life and divine love (John 15:7). As a result, they are drawn to God, who is added to them. This is the increase gained by the vital groups. 

## Three Characteristics

### Fruit bearing (purpose)
### Spiritual (nature)
### Love (condition)

Without love, everything we do related to the vital groups is in vain. Love builds up (1 Cor. 8:1), is not jealous, is not provoked, does not take account of evil, covers all things, endures all things, never falls away, and is the greatest (1 Cor. 13:4-8, 13). This is foundational for the aforementioned purpose and nature of the vital groups.

## Two Descriptors

It's easy to get into teaching, into doctrine, but without the divine life, that is merely dead works. Therefore, to be a vital person is to be contrary to these dead works: to be living and active. We have to look to the Lord's mercy and grace desperately to vitalize ourselves and others.

### Living

### Active

## Application

We must drop our opinions and be open, in order to enter into the practice of the vital groups. We have to come together, pray, open to one another and seek the Lord that we can be blended as a group. Otherwise it's going to be difficult to have much impact with anyone.

We have to take care of fellowship, intercession, mutual care and shepherding. These four things should be done in a very spontaneous way, and begins with fellowshipping and getting to know one another's situation. Then, we can pray i.e. intercede for one another. This prayer will lead to a mutual care for one another, which is expressed through shepherding - the actual rendering of help.
