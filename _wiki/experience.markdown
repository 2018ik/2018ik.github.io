## Background

**Experience** follows knowledge, and is closely related to revelation. Experience begins with Christ being revealed in a genuine way. This is beyond following Christian practices or learning Christian teachings, which are objective. Real experiences are revealed subjectively by the Holy Spirit.

## Experience of Life

All genuine experiences of God according to His New Testament economy should lead us to Christ, who is is life. Thus experiencing life requires experiencing Christ as the life-giving Spirit. To experience Christ as life, one should be familiar with what they received in their regeneration: a new heart and a new spirit. Upon regeneration, the spirit receives God and is mingled with God to become God (1 Cor. 6:17). Then, our communion with God is through our person that is the new heart (2 Cor. 3:16).

Not all experiences of God are life-giving. For example, Samson in the Old Testament had the Spirit of God fall upon him to empower him, but he did not experience life. There was no change in his person, he was only outwardly clad in strength. When a person experiences Christ, he simply senses Christ Himself and is not aware of anything outward. Others may realize how happy, loving, humble or patient he is, but he does not sense these things, only the presence of Christ. 

### Stages

In Paul's epistles, there is a progression of Christ being revealed in us (Gal. 1:15:16), Christ living in the us (Gal. 2:20), Christ being formed in us (Gal. 4:19) and Christ being magnified in us (Phil 1:20). Eventually, we arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:13). Based on the context, this is a Body matter, as the fullness of Christ is His Body.

## Foundation

Real experiences are founded on God's word. Any experience outside of the boundaries of the divine revelation are not a genuine experience of Christ as life. The only way we know what we experience is genuine is by coming to the Word of God.

Throughout history, there are many who participate in strange practices, some of which are somewhat founded in God's word, but whenever the emphasis in the Scriptures is lost, it's easy for our natural man to tend toward extremes. This is the case with the Magi in Matthew chapter 2; they had a living experience of Christ, and they followed the star. Because of a lack of understanding in God's word they followed their religious concepts; rather than following the star they went to Jerusalem where they thought this is where the king should be. This is what caused the first martyrs of the New Testament: all these ones that Herod killed because these magi had presumed the location of the King. 

The magi were then corrected by the priests and scribes through the Scriptures that the birth place would be in Bethlehem. When we have both the leading of the spirit as well the word, we are kept in lane.

## Tips
 
1. Set a timer for one minute, set aside everything else, and exercise to touch the Lord for that minute. If we are faithful to this minute each day, we will find this minute growing.
