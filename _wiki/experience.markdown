## Background

## Foundation

Real experiences are founded on God's word. Any experience outside of the boundaries of the divine revelation are not a genuine experience of Christ as life. The only way we know what we experience is genuine is by coming to the Word of God.

Throughout history, there are many who participate in strange practices, some of which are somewhat founded in God's word, but whenever the emphasis in the scriptures is lost, it's easy for our natural man to tend toward extremes. This is the case with the Magi in Matthew chapter 2; they had a living experience of Christ, and they followed the star. Because of a lack of understanding in God's word they followed their religious concepts and rather than following the star they went to jerusalem where they thought this is where the king should be. This is what caused the first martyrs of the New Testament all these ones that herod killed because these magi had presumed the location of the king. 

The magi were then corrected by the priests and scribes through the scriptures that the birth place would be in Bethlehem. When we have both the leading of the spirit as well as the word, we are kept in lane.

To experience Christ is to taste Christ being distributed.

## Experiencing Christ as Life

In everything we do, we can experience Christ as life. 

## Tips
 
1. Set a timer for one minute, set aside everything else, and exercise to touch the Lord for that minute. If we are faithful to this minute each day, we will find this minute growing.
