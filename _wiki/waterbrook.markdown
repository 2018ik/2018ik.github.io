## Background

Canaan is a land of many waters, a land of flowing waters which flow through hills and valleys. The flowing of water is closely tied to topology; major rivers all have their sources in mountains. If there are mountains there also must be valleys. Therefore, the waters, mountains and valleys in Canaan are related. It is significant that Canaan is not a flat land but of many ups and downs. 

The Father as the source is the fountain, the Son as the expression is the spring, and the Spirit as the flow is waterbrook.
