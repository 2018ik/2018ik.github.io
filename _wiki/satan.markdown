## Background

## Tactics

### Different Teachings

Our human wisdom, philosophy and culture drives us to teach by human wisdom (1 Cor. 2:13), which generates different teachings apart from the Apostle's teaching.

## Uses

### Sifting

The Lord uses the enemy along with His cross to "sift us" (Job). That is, to remove all our negative things and to make them in resurrection. This is why in Acts chapter 1 they are in one accord.
