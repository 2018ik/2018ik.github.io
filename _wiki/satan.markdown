## Background

Satan (Hebrew meaning *adversary*) is 

## History

When Satan first came to man, he was hidden as a serpent.

In Job, Satan is seen conversing with God and the angels.

## Tactics

Satan is the father of lies (John 8:44). His tactics sow seeds of doubt to draw mankind away from faith in God's word.

### Substitutes

Satan offers many cheap knock-offs to substitute what God has given man. TODO

Our human wisdom, philosophy and culture drives us to teach by human wisdom (1 Cor. 2:13), which generates different teachings apart from the Apostle's teaching.

### Questioning

Just like how Satan tempted Eve in the fall of man, he will ask questions which twist the word of God. For example - "Did God really say that you cannot eat of any tree?" Similarly, in his temptation of Jesus in the wilderness, his questionings were actually just scripture taken out of context.

The fundamental problem with questions is that it engages the human mind. Doubt is something of the mind.

## Uses

### Sifting

The Lord uses the enemy along with His cross to "sift us" (Job; Luke 22). That is, to remove all our negative things and to make them in resurrection. This is why in Acts chapter 1 they are in one accord.
