## Background

**Light** is that which makes manifest (Eph. 5:13). True light is not a thing, such as a shining or presence, it is a Person, God Himself. This light gives us the direct sense and realization of sins, wrongdoings, mistakes, trespasses and shortages. 

## Biblical Definition

Ephesians 5 is the only place in the Bible which is "everything that makes manifest" (Eph 5:13). The word revelation in Greek is apokalupsis. Apo is to open, and kalupsis is a veil. Therefore, revelation simply means the removal of a veil. Light is related to revelation. To be enlightened means to receive a revelation. Once light comes, revelation comes. Revelation is determined by the amount of light received. Godâ€™s revelation is what we receive through His light; it is the effect of this light in us. When light comes from God and reaches us, we have revelation. The end result of light is revelation. 

## Contrast to Darkness

When we are in darkness, we think everything is fine because we can't see anything. Only when we are brought into the light do we see what's really there.

## Contrast to Introspection

God's presence which issues in the light will spontaneously reveal the hidden things we must deal with. There is no need for introspection of the mind. We only need to deal with what is revealed directly by the light.

## Agreement

We must agree with what is exposed by the light. By confessing, we agree with and acknowledge what we see in God as light.

## Blindness

The absent of light means we are blind.

### Elisha

Elisha struck the Syrians with blindness. The New Testament ministry to deal with the enemy is to make them blind, open their eyes, and give them a feast.

### Saul of Tarsus


## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>One a brother as at Ralph's and he was looking at a magazine in the supermarket, and someone said "brother so and so" and hurriedly he dropped the magazine. Why? Because that saint radiated the divine light to this brother. Don't you realize that sometimes you're not in your spirit and in your soul therefore in darkness? And then have you ever gotten a call from a brother and received light from this brother? Aren't you brought into the realm of light in that instant?
