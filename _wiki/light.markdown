## Background

**Light** is that which makes manifest (Eph. 5:13). True light is not a thing, such as a shining or presence, it is a Person, God Himself (1 John 1:5). This light gives us the direct sense and realization of sins, wrongdoings, mistakes, trespasses and shortages. 


The first thing which God did after the rebellion of Satan in Genesis 1:2 is to restore the light. 

## Biblical Definition

Clearly God is light (1 John 1:5). Likewise the word of God which is also God Himself in reality is likewise light (Psa. 119:105). Christ is also light (John 8:12; 9:5). The life of Christ is the light of men (John 1:4). The believers become light (Matt. 5:14; Phil. 2:15). The church is a lampstand which shines with light (Rev. 1:20).

Ephesians 5 is the only place in the Bible which strictly defines light as "everything that makes manifest" (Eph 5:13). Light is related to revelation. To be enlightened means to receive a revelation. Once light comes, revelation comes. Revelation is determined by the amount of light received. Godâ€™s revelation is what we receive through His light; it is the effect of this light in us. When light comes from God and reaches us, we have revelation. The end result of light is revelation. 

## Contrast to Darkness

When we are in darkness, we think everything is fine because we can't see anything. Only when we are brought into the light do we see what's really there.

## Contrast to Introspection

God's presence which issues in the light will spontaneously reveal the hidden things we must deal with. There is no need for introspection of the mind. We only need to deal with what is revealed directly by the light.

## Agreement

We must agree with what is exposed by the light. By confessing, we agree with and acknowledge what we see in God as light.

## Blindness

The absent of light is blindness.

### Elisha

Elisha struck the Syrians with blindness. The New Testament ministry to deal with the enemy is to make them blind, open their eyes, and give them a feast.

### Saul of Tarsus

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>One a brother as at Ralph's and he was looking at a magazine in the supermarket, and someone said "brother so and so" and hurriedly he dropped the magazine. Why? Because that saint radiated the divine light to this brother. Don't you realize that sometimes you're not in your spirit and in your soul therefore in darkness? And then have you ever gotten a call from a brother and received light from this brother? Aren't you brought into the realm of light in that instant?
