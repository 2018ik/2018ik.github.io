## Background

The light is not a thing, such as a shining or presence, it is a Person, God Himself. This light gives us the direct sense and realization of sins, wrongdoings, mistakes, trespasses and shortages. 

## Contrast to Darkness

When we are in darkness, we think everything is fine because we can't see anything. Only when we are brought into the light do we see what's really there.

## Contrast to Introspection

God's presence which issues in the light will spontaneously reveal the hidden things we must deal with. There is no need for introspection of the mind. We only need to deal with what is revealed directly by the light.

## Agreement

We must agree with what is exposed by the light. By confessing, we agree with and acknowledge what we see in God as light.
