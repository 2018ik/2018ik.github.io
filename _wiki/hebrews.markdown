## Background

The book of **Hebrews**, most likely written by Paul, shows that Christ is superior to Judaism and its concepts, and brought forth the new covenant of grace which is superior to the old covenant. Christ is the reality of the types, shadows, and figures in the Old Testament which are merely an example for the real and living Christ (Heb. 9:23).
