## Background

The processed Triune God refers to God's going through of many processes, namely incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. The end result of the processed Triune God is that He can enter into man. Before, God was like an orange, but now, he has been processed into juice for us to enjoy in a practical way.

## Processes

God was incarnated, coming as the only-begotten Son of God (John 3:16). Then, he went through thirty-three and a half years of human living, followed by His crucifixion. Then, he was resurrected and glorified (LWuke 24:26) which made Him the Firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29) and the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Then He ascended and was made Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36) and head over all things to the church (Eph. 1:22-23).
