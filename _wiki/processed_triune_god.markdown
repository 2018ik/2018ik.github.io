## Background

The processed Triune God refers to God's going through of many processes, namely incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. The end result of the processed Triune God is that He can enter into man. Before, God was like an orange, but now, he has been processed into juice for us to enjoy in a practical way.

## Processes

God was incarnated, coming as the only-begotten Son of God (John 3:16). Then, he went through thirty-three and a half years of human living, followed by His crucifixion. Then, he was resurrected and glorified (LWuke 24:26) which made Him the Firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29) and the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Then He ascended and was made Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36) and head over all things to the church (Eph. 1:22-23).

## Examples

God becoming man (John 1:1; 1:14) and man becoming the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) was a process so that man can take in and enjoy God. There are many real-world examples of processes which raw materials go through in order to be enjoyed by man.

### Orange

A whole orange cannot be swallowed by man. Thus, the orange needs to go through a process of peeling and slicing, to become the slices. 

### Steak
