## Background

The **bride** or wife of Christ is the church, the Body of Christ, who enjoys a wedding feast with Christ in the millennial kingdom (Rev. 19:7-9) and later consummated as the New Jerusalem descending out of heaven as a bride adorned for her husband (Rev. 21:2).

On one hand, the bride as the wife and counterpart of Christ must be made ready, that is to reach maturity in life (Rev. 19:7). Furthermore, she must be beautified (Eph. 5:25-27) and equipped as a warrior for God's army (Eph. 6; Rev. 19:11-21). On the other hand, the bride as the church and as a city (the New Jerusalem) must be built up (Matt. 16:18; Eph. 2:21-22; 4:15-16).
