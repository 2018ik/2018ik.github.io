## Background

The **bride** or wife of Christ is the church, the Body of Christ, who enjoys a wedding feast with Christ in the millennial kingdom (Rev. 19:7-9) and is later consummated as the New Jerusalem descending out of heaven as a bride adorned for her husband (Rev. 21:2). Ephesians 5 shows that Christ loved the church as a husband loves his wife. He who loves his own wife loves himself (Eph. 5:28), which means that Christ loving the church is actually Christ loving himself - the Head and the Body are one.

On one hand, the bride as the wife and counterpart of Christ must be made ready, that is to reach maturity in life (Rev. 19:7). Furthermore, she must be beautified (Eph. 5:25-27) and equipped as a warrior for God's army (Eph. 6; Rev. 19:11-21). On the other hand, the bride as the church and as a city (the New Jerusalem) must be built up (Matt. 16:18; Eph. 2:21-22; 4:15-16).
