## Background

The **bride** (or **wife** or **counterpart**) of Christ is the church who enjoys a wedding feast with Christ in the millennial kingdom (Rev. 19:7-9) and is later consummated as the New Jerusalem descending out of heaven as a bride adorned for her husband (Rev. 21:2). The church today is being prepared to be the Lord's bride. In particular, the church in this aspect implies satisfaction and rest in love. 

On one hand, the bride as the wife and counterpart of Christ must be made ready, that is to reach maturity in life (Rev. 19:7). Furthermore, she must be beautified (Eph. 5:25-27) and equipped as a warrior for God's army (Eph. 6; Rev. 19:11-21). On the other hand, the bride as the church and as a city (the New Jerusalem) must be built up (Matt. 16:18; Eph. 2:21-22; 4:15-16).

## Biblical Basis

Adam and Eve typify Christ and the church (see: Eve)

Ephesians 5 shows that Christ loved the church as a husband loves his wife. He who loves his own wife loves himself because the wife and the husband are one flesh (Eph. 5:28); likewise, Christ loving the church is actually Christ loving himself since the Head and the Body are one (1 Cor. 12:12).

## Significance

The bride has to be made ready, which means that the church has to be built up by the believers' need to grow in life (Rev. 19:7). This preparation is signified by the bridal garment (Rev. 19:8; Matt. 22:11).
