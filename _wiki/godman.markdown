## Background

God-man, a portmanteau of God and man, refers to the fact that after regeneration, man is spiritually reborn with the life of God (John 3:5), as an entirely new "species." 

## Biblical Basis

## Living 

This God-man living consists of the eight items of organic salvation. The commencement of the God-man living is our being born of God through regeneration. We need a particular beginning to have a certain kind of living. The living must have the birth as its beginning.
