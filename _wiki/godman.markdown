## Background

**God-man**, a portmanteau of God and man, refers to the fact that after regeneration, man is spiritually reborn with the life of God (John 3:5), as an entirely new "species." A God-man lives by the mingled spirit. Godman differs in conotation from "children of God," which while it literally means the same thing, does not as strongly imply the aspect of being a new species.

## Biblical Basis

When one is regenerated, they become a child of God (John 1:12), which implies that the child posseses the same life as the Father. This is the divine and human life of Christ, which constitutes believers as children of God. 

Romans 1:3 and 1:4 reveal that the Lord Jesus Christ was out of the seed of David, and designated the Son of God. The Son of God is God Himself. Christ has two sources: one is the flesh, and the other is the Spirit of holiness. 2 Peter 1:4 says that the believers are partakers of the divine nature. John 3:6 says that which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Bring born of Spirit to be spirit means to be the same species as the Spirit, which is Christ, who posseses both divinity and humanity, ergo: God-man.

## Living 

Children of God need to grow into full-grown men, which is through the living of the God-man (1 Cor 2:6; 14:20; 16:13; Eph 4:13; Phil 3:15; Col 1:28; Heb 5:14).

This God-man living consists of the eight items of organic salvation. The commencement of the God-man living is our being born of God through regeneration. We need a particular beginning to have a certain kind of living. The living must have the birth as its beginning. A God-man starts his life as a babe (1 Pet 2:2), then, the believers need the feeding and shepherding of Christ.
