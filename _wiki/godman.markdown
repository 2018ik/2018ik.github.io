## Background

God-man, a portmanteau of God and man, refers to the fact that after regeneration, man is spiritually reborn with the life of God (John 3:5), as an entirely new "species" and then man needs to grow unto salvation (1 Peter 2:2).

## Biblical Basis

When one is regenerated, they become a child of God (John 1:12), which implies that the child posseses the same life as the Father. This is the divine and human life of Christ, which constitutes believers as children of God. However, children then need to grow into full-grown men (1 Cor 2:6; 14:20; 16:13; Eph 4:13; Phil 3:15; Col 1:28; Heb 5:14). Thus, this term God-man was coined to emphasize the importance of organic salvation and growth in life even after regeneration.

## Living 

This God-man living consists of the eight items of organic salvation. The commencement of the God-man living is our being born of God through regeneration. We need a particular beginning to have a certain kind of living. The living must have the birth as its beginning. A God-man starts his life as a babe (1 Pet 2:2), then, the believers need the feeding and shepherding of Christ.
