## Background

**Mixture** is the bringing in of natural concepts into God's New Testament economy, for example to bring in Old Testament rituals and praises. 

For example, there is nothing wrong to say that God is merciful and that His mercy endures forever. But to sing this and praise this in natural way is to undermine God's economy. There is actually not a single verse in the New Testament that says God's mercy endures forever. Thus, to recite this with no further revelation conveys no sense of God's incarnation or that He has become one with man.
