## Background

Marah means bitterness, and was a location the children of Israel encountered during their exodus after a three day search for water. 

## History

The children of Israel went three days without water, and eventually ended up in Marah, where the water was bitter. Moses cried out to Jehovah, and Jehovah showed him a tree, which he casted into the water, making the water sweet (Exo 15:22-26).

## Significance

The miracle on the third day represents the day of Christ's resurrection. The tree signifies the cross of the crucified and resurrected Christ. Just as moses saw a vision of a tree and cast this tree into the bitter waters, we need to apply Him as the crucified and resurrected Christ to the bitterness in our being. Then the bitter waters will become the sweet waters of His refreshing presence of rest and full satisfaction.
