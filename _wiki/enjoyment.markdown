## Background

Christ is our allotted portion to be our enjoyment (Col. 1:12). This enjoyment is actually the unique solution to all problems in the church. The way to enjoy the Lord is to love Him (1 Cor. 2:9-10; 16:22).

Actually, the more limited one is, the more they should enjoy. Enjoyment should not be tied to the environment; if it is, then it is not true enjoyment. Paul was in prison, yet the high peak truths he revealed in his epistles were all during imprisonment.

## Significance

To enjoy is different from experiencing. For example, a kid can eat vegetables and experience it, but not enjoy it. 

The enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ solves all the problems in the church through the work of the cross to make us spiritual men for God's building. The genuine enjoyment of Christ includes the death of Christ in the compound spirit (Exo. 30:22-25) with its killing element, which is applied to all the negative persons, things and matters related to us in our daily life, church life, and work, so that we may live a crucified life by the power of Christ's resurrection life (Phil 1:19; 3:10).

There is a sweetness to the killing element of Christ's death, as seen in the cinnamon in the compound ointment. When negative matters trouble us in our daily life, we can enjoy the compound ointment, and all these troubling things are eliminated and killed, and we are in resurrection.

## Issuing

The enjoyment of God issues in Him making His home in our hearts.

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>First Corinthians reveals the way to enjoy the Lord is to love Him - not to study Him. However, I was reminded of our study times in the full-time training. We have about 12 hours of study time each week in the training - which is a fair bit. If we spent all this time studying doctrine, studying dead letter, it would be miserable. But this studying is actually a feast. We can enter into and enjoy all the riches of Christ through our studying. Through our pray-reading. Through our PSRP. 
>
>At first, I had indifferent to negative enjoyment towards reading the Bible, reading the life studies, but as long as well continue to know and experience God, and exercise our spirit, we can enjoy God! I hope one day we have such an enjoyment that we can study 60 hours every week. May we have such an appetite.

### Testimony #2

>When Brother Lee was a young coworker, after he would give a good message, he made it the standard for all his upcoming messages. Then that became his standard, so in his feeling, if he didn't reach that standard, he got condemned. 
>
>We can do the same thing. I remember giving a testimony many years ago where I felt like I hit a grand slam home run. That doesn't happen to me anymore, but I wanted to hit a grand slam every time. You shouldn't even be in that realm. It's not about grand slams; it's about ministering Christ to one another. Sometimes the Lord might be excited, and we want to be excited and one with Him. If He wants to speak a sober word, we want to speak it and be on with Him to speak those sober words. 
>
>Sometimes He speaks serious words, mourning words, warning words. The point is, we're not into trying to do spectacular things. Sometimes sisters like to hear many strong, strong amens, especially from these \[leading\] brothers over here. You may give a testimony and Rick and Dennis' heads are down. They're not against you; they're just exhausted. Anyway, when you give a testimony, you're not going to get smiles from them. We're here to please the Lord Jesus.
