## Background

Christ is our allotted portion to be our enjoyment (Col. 1:12). This enjoyment is actually the unique solution to all problems in the church. The way to enjoy the Lord is to love Him (2:9-10; 16:22).

The more limited we are, the more we should enjoy. Paul was in prison, and the high peak truths he revealed in his epistles were all during imprisonment.

## Testimony

### Testimony #1

>First Corinthians reveals the way to enjoy the Lord is to love Him - not to study Him. However, I was reminded of our study times in the full-time training. We have about 12 hours of study time each week in the training - which is a fair bit. If we spent all this time studying doctrine, studying dead letter, it would be miserable. But this studying is actually a feast. We can enter into and enjoy all the riches of Christ through our studying. Through our pray-reading. Through our PSRP.

>At first, I had indifferent to negative enjoyment towards reading the Bible, reading the life studies, but as long as well continue to know and experience God, and exercise our spirit, we can enjoy God! I hope one day we have such an enjoyment that we can study 60 hours every week. May we have such an appetite.
