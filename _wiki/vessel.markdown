## Background

Man was created as a **vessel**: a container which can hold God. Paul often used the word "vessel" in his writings (Romans 9:21; 9:23; 2 Cor. 4:7), having learned this from being called a "chosen vessel" by God (Acts 9:15). God did not create man solely as servants who must do something for God; man was made as a vessel to contain God. 

To be a vessel opposes man's "doing." A vessel doesn't "do" anything, it just contains its intended contents. For man to "do" something out of his natural self is to be presumptuous, and to usurp God's original intention for man. Without being filled by God, man can never fulfill God's economy.

## Biblical Basis

Romans 9:21 and 23 reveals that God's created man to be vessels to make known the riches of His glory. 2 Corinthians 4:7 conveys the same thought. These directly indicate that man is vessel, but even in the creation of man, God breathed into the outward receptacle of dust with the breath of life, giving life to man (Gen 2:7). Then, God placed man in the garden so that he may eat, to take in what God has prepared (Gen. 2:8-9).

A temple or dwelling place is technically speaking a vessel made for a person to occupy, and it is clear that man is actually a temple for God to occupy (1 Cor. 6:19). Ephesians 3:16-17 also says that God wants Christ to make His home in man's heart. When God occupies man, He is filling and dwelling within the vessel of man. This all begins in the human spirit.

## Significance

The thought of doing something for God out of the self is part of man's fallen nature, which seeks independence from God. As a vessel, man's first and primary responsibility is to be filled, and from the filling, the work is the overflow.
