## Background

Man was created as a **vessel**: a container which can hold the God of honor, the God of glory. Paul often used the word "vessel" in his writings (Romans 9:21; 9:23; 2 Cor. 4:7), having learned this from being called a "chosen vessel" by God (Acts 9:15).

If we don't see and recognize God as our contents, we are a senseless contradiction. We were made to contain God.
