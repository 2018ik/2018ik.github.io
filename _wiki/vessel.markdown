## Background

Mankind was created as a **vessel**, a container for holding God. Paul in his epistles described the relationship between God and man as the relationship between a Potter and His vessels (Romans 9:21; 9:23; 2 Cor. 4:7). This revelation was likely sourced from his being called a "chosen vessel" by God (Acts 9:15). Within this chosen vessel is a [treasure](../treasure_in_earthen_vessels): Christ Himself (2 Cor. 4:7).

To be a vessel is contrary to man's "doing." A vessel doesn't "do" anything, it just contains its intended contents. Inherently within man is a desire to pursue and to achieve. Thus, man begins to pursue knowledge and success, even with the intent of pleasing God. However, God does not want man to try to do anything for Him; He only wants us to love Him and to open ourselves to him. Notice that man was created on the sixth day, after everything else - every plant that was pleasant to the sight and good for food - was already prepared in the prior days. The seventh day was a day of rest for both man and God.

For man to "do" something out of his natural self is to be presumptuous, and to usurp God's original intention for man (it could be said that Eve's initial sin was prior to eating the fruit, but interacting with the serpent in the first place apart from God). Without being filled by God, man can never fulfill God's economy.

When a vessel is open to God to be constituted with His divine nature, it is honorable, made of gold and silver. When a vessel is closed, it is dishonorable, wooden and earthen (2 Tim. 2:20). 

## Biblical Basis

Romans 9:21 and 23 reveals that God's created man to be vessels to make known the riches of His glory. 2 Corinthians 4:7 conveys the same thought, except it describes these vessels as earthen, or clay, referring to the fleshly body. These directly indicate that man is vessel. But even in the creation of man, God breathed into the outward receptacle of dust with the breath of life, giving life to man (Gen 2:7). Then, God placed man in the garden so that he may eat, to take in what God has prepared (Gen. 2:8-9).

It is also clear that man is a temple for God to occupy (1 Cor. 6:19). Ephesians 3:16-17 also says that God wants Christ to make His home in man's heart. When God occupies man, He is filling and dwelling within the vessel of man. This all begins in the human spirit. 

## Significance

The thought of doing something for God out of the self is part of man's fallen nature, which seeks independence from God. As a vessel, man's first and primary responsibility is to be filled, and from the filling, the work is the overflow.

## Potter

A Christian's trials and sufferings can be likened to the potter and his clay. The potter will always pass the clay through after painting it. The painting is like the knowledge and revelation that we receive, which practically is of no use to us in experiencing life and is not rich to us. However, we may be very confident in our knowledge and believe ourselves to be spiritual. Thus, the clay being baked represents God passing us through trials to burn the objective knowledge we have into real spiritual experience. These trials humble us.
