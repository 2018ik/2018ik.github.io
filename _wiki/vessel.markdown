## Background

Man was created as a **vessel**: a container which can hold God. Paul often used the word "vessel" in his writings (Romans 9:21; 9:23; 2 Cor. 4:7), having learned this from being called a "chosen vessel" by God (Acts 9:15). It is not enough for man to be a mere servant of God, man was made to contain God and to become one with God.

## Biblical Basis

Romans 9:21 and 23 reveals that God's created man to be vessels to make known the riches of His glory. 2 Corinthians 4:7 conveys the same thought. These directly indicate that man is vessel, but even in the creation of man, God breathed into the outward receptacle of dust the breath of life, filling man with life (Gen 2:7). 

A temple or dwelling place is technically speaking a vessel made for someone to occupy. It is clear that man is actually a temple for God to occupy (1 Cor. 6:19). Ephesians 3:16-17 also says that God wants Christ to make His home in man's heart. When God occupies man, He is filling the vessel which is man.
