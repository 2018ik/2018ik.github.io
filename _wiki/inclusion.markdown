## Background

**Inclusion** is the second stage of the full ministry of Christ in three stages where Christ becomes the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Inclusion does not refer to the believers being "included" in Christ's work, although that is technically true. Inclusion refers to all that Christ accomplished in the stage of incarnation being compounded i.e. *included* into the life-giving Spirit which is now in man. His fine humanity, His God-expressing human living, His life-releasing death, His all-surpassing resurrection, and His all-transcending ascension has been compounded into the life-giving Spirit.

Without knowing that all that Christ is has been compounded into the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, we are inevitably left asking the question "what would Jesus do?" We are not here to imitate the life of Jesus, but we are here to drink the Spirit of Jesus that all the divine attributes may be expressed in our human virtues. The all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is the Spirit of the lowly, despised, persecuted, resurrected, glorified, enthroned, crowned, Jesus. All that Jesus experienced in His human living and death must be experienced in our history, and become a reality to us.

The three accomplishments of inclusion is as follows:

1. For Christ as the only-begotten Son of God in eternity to be begotten as God's firstborn Son (Rom. 8:29)
2. For Christ to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor 15:45)
   1. The Lord is on the throne, but he is also in us as the Spirit. We believe all that the Bible says without making a system out of it.
   2. The life-giving Spirit is for the Lord to carry out organic salvation
3. For Christ to regenerate the believers for His Body

## Biblical Basis

Philippians 1:19 refers to the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. This does not say the Spirit of God because it serves to emphasize the fact that Jesus who became a man was now the Christ in resurrection. All that the Lord experienced in His humanity are ingredients which have been compounded with the Spirit of God as the Spirit of Jesus Christ which was then able to bountifully supply Paul in his sufferings.
