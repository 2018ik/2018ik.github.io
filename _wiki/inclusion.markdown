## Background

Inclusion is the second stage of the history of what Christ is, and is the stage where Christ becomes the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45).

Without knowing that all that Christ is has been compounded into the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, we are inevitably left asking the question "what would Jesus do?" We are not here to imitate the life of Jesus, but we are here to drink the Spirit of Jesus that all the divine attributes may be expressed in our human virtues. The all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is the Spirit of the lowly, despised, persecuted, resurrected, glorified, enthroned, crowned, Jesus. All that Jesus experienced in His human living and death must be experienced in our history, and become a reality to us.

## Position in the [Full Ministry](./full_ministry)

We are not in Christ's "inclusion" because we are "included" in Christ's work. No, we speak of inclusion because all that Christ accomplished has been compounded i.e. *included* into the life-giving Spirit. The seven-fold intensified Spirit then intensifies all the elements of this life-giving Spirit.
