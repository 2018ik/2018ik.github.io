## Background

The leaves and the branches are practices in the Bible which help the central and supplemental lines. This includes but is not limited to: the God-ordained way, the Lord's table, the administration of the local church, head covering, foot washing, the rapture, the keeping of days, the handling of idol sacrifices, one cup vs. many cups at the table, and bread leavening.

We need to use these matters, but we should not be distracted by them.

For example, head covering is to bring us into the realization of the universal headship of Christ. The first person that practiced foot-washing in the Bible was the Lord Jesus. It brings the believers back into the fellowship of the Body of Christ. These practices are not for the physical practice, but for bringing the believers back into the central line.
