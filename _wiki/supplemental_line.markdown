## Background

This line of supplemental points are not the main thing which we speak of in a complete way. We do not reject others based on the supplemental line.

## Items

These are just examples, there are many more items.

### Prophecies Concerning Christ

The Old Testament paints a colorful picture of Christ, but it is not the central point. These are points which bring us into the all-inclusive Christ.

### Old Testament Types

These types such as Adam as Christ, Eve as the church, Israel as the children of God and  the tabernacle as God's habitation are all pictures which brings us into the reality revealed in the New Testament, which is Christ.

### Church

Churches are supplementary to the Body of Christ. The church brings us into the reality of the Body of Christ, not vice versa.

### The Kingdom

This refers to the kingdom reward in the end times, as well as the judgement seat and weddings feast.
