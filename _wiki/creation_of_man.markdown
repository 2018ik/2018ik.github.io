## Background

The **creation of man** was for the fulfillment of [God's eternal purpose](../economy), which is to dispense Himself into man that man may express Him. This is recorded in Genesis chapters 1 and 2, where man is created out of dust in the image and likeness of God.

## Biblical Record

### Genesis 1:26

God said "let *Us* make man in *our* image." This indicates the Divine Trinity: the Father, Son and Spirit. God has always been triune, and God is triune in order to dispense Himself into man. Therefore, the creation of man since the beginning was to carry out His economy by dispensing Himself into man.

God created man in His image and according to His likeness. Image refers to the expression of God's attributes and virtues, while likeness refers to the literal outward form, that is man's physical body. 

The word image is reiterated in Colossians 1:15 and 2 Corinthians 4:4, which show Christ, the Son of God, is the image of God. This image is not a physical image, but the expression of what God is in all His attributes and virtues. For example, God as the Father loves and is love, but this love can only be expressed through man.

However, the image which man was created did not include the content or reality of the image. Man can love out of the self, but this virtue is not God's love unless God occupies and uses man as a vessel to express Himself through man. A glove is made in the image of a hand, but without the hand, the glove simply looks somewhat like a hand with no reality behind its hand-ness.

To be made it God's likeness refers to the outward form. God appeared to Abraham in the likeness of a man because that is His inherent outward form. 

While all the other living creatures were created according their own kind (Gen. 1:24-25), man was created in the image of God, according to His likeness. 

### Genesis 2:7

God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life. This breath of life is the spirit, and is translated as such in Proverbs 20:27. This is not the eternal life of God, as Genesis 3:22-24 reveals that that only after partaking of the tree of life will man live forever.

Then, the body is seen in the formation from the dust, and the soul is seen in man becoming a "living soul." When the spiritual breath and bodily dust came together, the soul was produced. That man was created tripartite with body, soul and spirit was very purposeful, so that man can receive and express God.

### Genesis 2:9

Man was placed in a garden with "every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food" as well as the tree of life and tree of the knowledge of good and evil. This shows that God created man with a free will, and His intention is for man to eat and enjoy, but more specifically to eat the tree of life. Man is actually just a vessel made in the image and likeness of God to contain God as food.
