## Background

The **creation of man** was for the fulfillment of [God's eternal purpose](../economy), which is to dispense Himself into man that man may express Him and become His duplication. This is recorded in Genesis chapters 1 and 2, where man is created out of dust in the image and likeness of God. 

## Biblical Record

### Genesis 1:26

God said "let *Us* make man in *our* image." This indicates the Divine Trinity: the Father, Son and Spirit. God has always been triune, and God is triune in order to dispense Himself into man. Therefore, the creation of man since the beginning was to carry out His economy by dispensing Himself into man.

God created man in His image and according to His likeness. Image refers to the expression of God's attributes and virtues, while likeness refers to the literal outward form, that is man's physical body. 

The word image is reiterated in Colossians 1:15 and 2 Corinthians 4:4, which show Christ, the Son of God, is the image of God. This image is not a physical image, but the expression of what God is in all His attributes and virtues. For example, God as the Father loves and is love, but this love can only be expressed through man.

However, the image which man was created did not include the content or reality of the image. Man can love out of the self, but this virtue is not God's love unless God occupies and uses man as a vessel to express Himself through man. A glove is made in the image of a hand, but without the hand, the glove simply looks somewhat like a hand with no reality behind its hand-ness.

To be made it God's likeness refers to the outward form. God appeared to Abraham in the likeness of a man because that is His inherent outward form. 

While all the other living creatures were created according their own kind (Gen. 1:24-25), man was created in the image of God, according to His likeness. 

### Genesis 2:7

God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life. This breath of life is the spirit, and is translated as such in Proverbs 20:27. This is not the eternal life of God, as Genesis 3:22-24 reveals that that only after partaking of the tree of life will man live forever. Furthermore, God works according to the principle of free will. 

Then, the body is seen in the formation from the dust, and the soul is seen in man becoming a "living soul." When the spiritual breath and bodily dust came together, the soul was produced. That man was created tripartite with body, soul and spirit was very purposeful, so that man can receive and express God.

This verse also reveals the Trinity: God can be understood here as the Father, the source. The Son can be understood as both the words spoken by God (John 1:1) as well as the image and likeness by which man was created. Lastly, the Spirit is seen as the breath of life which was breathed into man's nostrils.

### Genesis 2:9

Man was placed in a garden with "every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food" as well as the tree of life and tree of the knowledge of good and evil. This shows that God created man with a free will, and His intention is for man to eat and enjoy, but more specifically to eat the tree of life. Man is actually just a vessel made in the image and likeness of God to contain God as food.

### Zechariah 12:1

God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundations of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him. This ordering shows that the heavens are for the earth, and the earth is for man. Without the heavens to give sunshine, air, and rain, the earth could not function, and humans cannot live. Likewise, without planet earth and the living things on earth, man could not live. Therefore, the purpose of creating all other things was actually for man, and especially for the center of man that is his spirit. 

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>My children recently got me one of these things [holds up air pods]. These can be used for many things, for example as a bookmark, if you have a really thick book or something. If you open it up, and then take out one of them you can even use it to stir. But the creator's intention behind this is actually to stick the earbuds into the ear to listen to things. Likewise, so many people don't see God's intention for man. If there is a God, there must be a way for Him to reveal His intention. Well, the Bible is the complete written divine revelation from God to man. The Bible is the basis for all our fellowship and classes in the training, we don't use anything else, we take the Bible as our basis. The Bible speaks directly about the eternal purpose of our God. If I was you, I would ask "what is the eternal purpose of God?" I know my purpose; everyone lives according to their purpose. But what is God's purpose in the creation of man and in the creation of the universe? God is not a purposeless God, He does not create things at random. Man does not do that either, and because man is made in the image of God, surely it follows that God creates with a purpose and intention. Sometimes we are focused on our own purpose, we want to see what is the eternal purpose of God. Ephesians 3:11 says that God has an eternal purpose throughout the ages.
