## Background

The **creation of man** was for the fulfillment of [God's eternal purpose](../economy), which is to dispense Himself into man that man may express Him. This is recorded in Genesis chapters 1 and 2, where man is created out of dust in the image and likeness of God.

## Biblical Record

### Genesis 1:26

God said "let *Us* make man in *our* image." This indicates the Divine Trinity: the Father, Son and Spirit. God has always been triune, and God is triune in order to dispense Himself into man. Therefore, the creation of man since the beginning was to carry out His economy by dispensing Himself into man.

This image is reiterated in Colossians 1:15 and 2 Corinthians 4:4, which show Christ, the Son of God, as the image of God. This image is the expression of what God is in all His attributes and virtues. This means man has all of God's attributes and virtues so that man can express Him. However, this is just the outward image, not the content. In order to express the reality of God's divine attributes and virtues, God must occupy and use man as a vessel to express Himself. For example, the glove is made in the image of a hand, but without the hand, the glove simply looks somewhat like a hand with no reality behind its hand-ness.

Likeness = outward form? TODO: what's the difference between image and likeness I have no idea

### Genesis 2:7

God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life. This breath of life is the spirit, and is translated as such in Proverbs 20:27. This is not the eternal life of God, as Genesis 3:22-24 reveals that that only after partaking of the tree of life will man live forever

Then, the body is seen in the formation from the dust, and the soul is seen in man becoming a "living soul." When the spiritual breath and bodily dust came together, the soul was produced. 

### Genesis 2:9

Man was placed in a garden with "every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food" as well as the tree of life and tree of the knowledge of good and evil. This shows that God created man with a free will, and His intention is for man to eat and enjoy, but more specifically to eat the tree of life. Man is actually just a vessel made in the image and likeness of God to contain God as food.
