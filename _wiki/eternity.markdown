## Background

God is eternal and exists from eternity past to eternity future.

On the human side, God has put eternity in Man's heart (Eccl. 3:11), therefore only God can satisfy man.

## Time

With God in eternity, there is no time concept. When He loves us, he loves us for eternity.

## The Heart

The eternity which has been put into man's hearts is described by the Amplified translation as "a divinely implanted sense of a purpose working through the ages which nothing under the sun, but only God, can satisfy."
