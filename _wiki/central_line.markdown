## Background

The **central line** is the main focus of the Bible, and are crucial truths which all believers agree on. This is different from the supplemental line and the leaves and branches, which are not elements of the faith and are a means to shepherd others to the central line. 

## Items

### The Word of God

The Word of God reveals God, who is the Word (John 1:1). From the Old Testament to the New Testament, the primary thing is God, and the written Word reveals Him to man. All understanding of the truth must be based on the Word of God. The Word can be interpreted, but the interpretation of the Word must be based on the Word itself.

### The Triune God

This refers to God Himself, as well as His trinity. God is both eternally one God (Psa. 86:10; Isa. 45:5) as well as eternally three (Matt 28:19). Believing in Jesus, the basic prerequisite for being saved (Rom. 10:8-13), as the Son of God, inherently involves believing in the Triune God.

### The Economy of God

As the Triune God is experienced and enjoyed, one will realize that He has an eternal purpose. His economy is His arrangement to fulfill His purpose.

### The All-inclusive Christ

The all-inclusive Christ refers to the Christ in the gospels as God becoming flesh (John 1:14), as well as His becoming the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). This is to know Christ in a full way in His three stages of incarnation, inclusion and intensification.ss

### The Life-giving Spirit

The Spirit is Christ's realization; hence He is called the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16:7), the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9-11), and the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19).

### The Body of Christ

### The New Jerusalem

The New Jerusalem is the goal of God's economy, and the aggregate of all visions and revelations of th Bible.
