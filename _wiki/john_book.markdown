### Way, Reality, Life

The Lord says that He is the way, reality and life in John 14:6. Way depends on reality depends on life. As one lives by Christ as life, they are brought into the reality which is the way through which they enter into the enjoyment of the Father. By the life of Christ, He becomes the reality of every human virtue.
