## Background

**Redemption** is God taking our place in suffering judgment and in the payment of debts. Redemption is the result of Godâ€™s love, and it is accomplished by the blood of Christ.

If one sins, he is guilty before God. In order for God to forgive sins, He must first judge them. When sins are judged, they can be removed. For example, if one commit a crime on the street and a policeman arrests him and brings him before a judge, the judge will not let him walk away. He must either pay the penalty or be imprisoned. Someone paying the penalty or being imprisoned in his place would be an example of Christ's dying in man's stead.

## Aspects

### Atonement

The atonement in the Old Testament was an expiation, which means to appease God. 

## Salvation

Redemption is what Christ accomplished in the eyes of God. Salvation is what God has wrought upon us based upon the redemption of Christ. Redemption is objective, and salvation is subjective. When redemption becomes our experience, it becomes salvation.
