## Background

**Redemption** is God taking our place in suffering judgment and in the payment of debts. Redemption is the result of Godâ€™s love, and it is accomplished by the blood of Christ.

[Man fell](../fall_of_man), sin entered, and man became unrighteous in the eyes of God. According to God's righteousness, everything of God must be righteous; therefore, for God to accomplish His economy, He must first make man righteous. This is accomplished through redemption.

In order for God to forgive sins, He must first judge them. When sins are judged, they can be removed. For example, if one commit a crime on the street and a policeman arrests him and brings him before a judge, the judge will not let him walk away. He must either pay the penalty or be imprisoned. Someone paying the penalty or being imprisoned in his place would be an example of Christ's dying in man's stead.

## Biblical Basis

According to the Bible, the wages of sin is death and blood must be shed for forgiveness (Heb. 9:22). In the Old Testament, the blood of animals worked as a dispensational, temporary measure to obtain expiation (Lev. 16:15-18), however it could not take away sins (Heb. 10:4). In order to accomplish a true redemption, there has to be a higher blood that is altogether sinless. Furthermore, this blood has to be offered for the entire fallen human race and all creation. Apparently, billions of sin offerings of the perfect blood would be needed to accomplish such a redemption. However, the Lord Jesus was both sinless (Rom. 8:3) and all things were created in Him and are held together in Him (Col. 1:16-17). Thus, He was able to reconcile all things to Himself through the blood of the cross (Col. 1:20).

## Aspects

### Atonement

The atonement in the Old Testament was an expiation, which means to appease God. 

### Salvation

Redemption is what Christ accomplished in the eyes of God. Salvation is what God has wrought upon us based upon the redemption of Christ. Redemption is objective, and salvation is subjective. When redemption becomes our experience, it becomes salvation. 

### Price

As redemption means a payment of debts, the Lord's redemption for us was Him paying the great price of His precious blood (1 Cor. 6:19-20; 1 Pet. 1:18-19). This was a price that we could not realistically pay, as the wages of sin is death. When we see the great price paid by the Lord, He becomes our personal Lord and Master and we give ourselves to Him. All that we have, do, and are will be [to God](../living_to_the_lord).
