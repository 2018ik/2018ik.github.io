## Background

Redemption is God taking our place in suffering judgment and in the payment of debts. Redemption is the result of Godâ€™s love, and it is accomplished by the blood of Christ.

If one sins, he is guilty before God. In order for God to forgive sins, He must first judge them. When sins are judged, they can be removed. For example, if one commit a crime on the street and a policeman arrests him and brings him before a judge, the judge will not let him walk away. He must either pay the penalty or be imprisoned.
