## Background

The **Divine Trinity** (or **Triune God**) refer to God Himself in the three hypostases of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit which have coexisted simultaneously from eternity to eternity. The Father, Son, and Spirit are all the same God (1 Pet. 1:2; Heb 1:8; Acts 5:3-4), as God is only one (1 Cor. 8:4; Isa 45:5), yet also three. This is a mystery which cannot be fully understood by man (Matt. 11:27). The term "Trinity" is not directly mentioned in the Bible but was established by the early church fathers such as Tertullian, Origen, Athanasius, Basil and Augustine. Trinitarian theology served as a framework in which to study the Bible and is a basic tenet of the Christian faith. Today, we see that God is triune not for human understanding, but for Him to dispense Himself into man. 

## Importance

> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.

\-2 Cor. 13:14

God is triune in order to be experienced and enjoyed by man. The terms grace, love and fellowship are all related to God's reaching of man. The Father sends the Son in His name who is now the Spirit within us to make the entire Triune God real to us. God's operation throughout the New Testament and even the Old Testament is always in His Trinity. In many of the apostle's prayers, as in the above 2 Corinthians 13:14 involve the Trinity (further: Eph. 1:4-5; 3:16-17). To experience God in full one must know the Triune God. One's experience and gaining of Christ cannot surpass their knowledge and revelation of Christ (Phil. 3:8). 

## Characteristics

### Coexistence

The three of the Trinity coexist simultaneously from eternity to eternity. This means that the Father, the Son and the Spirit are God and exist eternally. There are many passages where the Father, Son and Spirit obviously all exist at the same point in time (Matt. 3:16-17; 2 Cor. 13:14; Eph. 3:14-17), but to prove the eternal coexistence of the Trinity we can simply show that all three hypostases are both God and eternal.

| Hypostasis | Being God | Being Eternal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Father |  | Isaiah 9:6 says "eternal Father." |
| Son | John 1:1 says that the Word, the Son was God. Acts 20:28 says that God obtained the church through His own blood showing that the Son possessing flesh and blood is God Himself. Romans 9:5 says Christ is God over all and blessed forever. | John 1:1-2 says that the Word was in the beginning with God. Hebrews 7:3 shows that the Son of God is without father and mother, having neither beginning of days nor end of life. Furthermore, the very existence of an eternal Father implies an eternal Son, since a father is only so because he has a son. |
| Spirit | | Hebrews 9:14 says "eternal Spirit." |

### Coinherence

The three of the Trinity coexist by coinhering, that is to mutually indwell one another and to exist as One. Explicitly, the Bible only states that the Father is in the Son, and that Son is in the Father (John 14:10) and that the Son is the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17). It can also be extrapolated that the Spirit is in the Son, as the Son coming as a tripartite God-man possessed the spirit of man in which the Spirit indwelled. However, it is not scriptural to state that the Son is "in" the Spirit, though such a statement can be argued as valid based on the oneness of the Three. 

The mutual indwelling as outlined above is the divine incorporation of God and man.

### One

The three of the Trinity are plainly One and the same in their nature and being, inseparable yet distinct. This is based on the oneness of the divine essence (Greek: *ousia*) in the Godhead. Verses in the Old Testament explicitly indicate that there is one God (Isa. 45:5; Psa. 86:10).

Furthermore, the hypostases of the Trinity are identified with each other. Isaiah 9:6 identifies the Son with the Father, and John 10:30 says the Son and Father are One. 2 Corinthians 3:17 identifies the Son with the Spirit. Acts 8:16 identifies the Lord Jesus with the entire Triune God when cross referenced with Matthew 28:19.

### Three

Even in the Old Testament, a plurality can be seen in God, for example in Genesis 1:26, God uses the plural pronouns "us" and "our" when referring to Himself. Matthew 28:19 is the only verse which plainly lists the three of the divine Trinity. In John 14:16, the Father, Son and Spirit all have pronouns:

>I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever.

The titles Father, Son and Spirit imply a *organic* distinction between the three of the Trinity. These terms are related to life; the relationship between a father and son is a life relationship. Spirit meaning *breath* is also strongly related to life. For an organism to have breath is a sign of life, and the Spirit called a Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2; 1 Cor. 15:45). 1 Corinthians 13:14 applies this distinction in the matter of experiencing God as life: the love of God the Father, the grace of Christ the Son, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. This verse is strong proof that the distinctions of the Three are not for doctrinal understanding but for God to fellowship with and dispense Himself as life into man. The Father is the source, the Son is the expression (the expression of the Father's love is His sending of the Son who is grace and reality), and the Spirit is the transmission (transmitting the grace of God to man by means of fellowship). 

Going further, the Father is the begetter, and the Son is the begotten. As the Son could not have been begotten at any point in time, it can be said that the Son is eternally begotten by the Father. Augustine and Aquinas understood the Spirit as the love between the Father and the Son, but more generally the Spirit is the essence which the Father is eternally dispensing into the Son by which to eternally beget the Son. 

| Hypostasis | Function | Relationship |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Father | Source, origin, purposer | In the Son as the Spirit |
| Son | Element, creator, accomplisher | With the Father as the Spirit |
| Spirit | Essence, executor, applier |  |

### Cooperation

Every significant operation of God's economy includes the three of the Trinity.

In the beginning in Genesis, God's intention is revealed in His creation of man, as well as His person. In the New Testament, it is clear that God is triune, and the purpose behind the Trinity is revealed. Even in the first verse of the Bible ("In the beginning, God created..."), we see a Triune God. The Hebrew word used for God *elohim* is grammatically plural, while the verb for created is singular. The fact that God is love also implies a plurality. Love requires both a subject and an object; the object of God the Father's love is the Son.

Genesis 1:2-3 following the first verse which reveals the Father then reveals the rest of the Triune God. The Spirit of God was explicitly stated to be brooding on the waters (Gen. 1:2). In verse three, God *said*, "Let there be light." God's word here implies the Son, who is the Word (John 1:1). Every operation of God is Triune - why did God need to say anything to create light? He had to create by the Son as the active instrument for everything to come into being.

In Genesis 1:26 when creating man, God says let *Us* make man in our image. This is also not the only time that the plural pronoun *Us* is used to refer to God (Isa. 6:8; Gen. 3:22; 11:7).

God as the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob also implies the Trinity as the Father, Son and Spirit. God called Abraham as the Father. Isaac as the son of Abraham inherited all that his father had and accomplished the will of his father. Jacob experienced a great work of transformation which corresponds to the transformative work of the Spirit.

In Matthew 12:18, the Lord Jesus casts out demons by the Spirit of God. Then, the kingdom that comes is not the kingdom of the son, but the kingdom of God. Then, in 28:19, baptism is in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

Luke 15 TODO

John 14:10-11 reveals the the Son is in the Father and the Son is in the Father. Furthermore, the Son not only does not speak from His own words, but it's actually the Father's working. There is one manifest action of the Son speaking, but in that action there are multiple operations: the speaking the Son and the working of the Father. There is a distinction in Persons and a distinction in operations but the manifest action is one.

John 14:16-17 says:

>I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality

This proves that the Father, Son, and Spirit all exist simultaneously, as the Son is able to ask the Father to send the Spirit.

2 Corinthians 13:14 speaks of the grace of Christ the Son, the love of God the Father, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. Love, grace, and fellowship are three items of one things; fellowship is the transmission of grace, and grace is the expression of love. 

In Ephesians 1:3, God the Father blessed us *in Christ*. 

Ephesians 3:14-17 says:

>That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love

Here the Father is granting us to be strengthened through His Spirit that Christ would make his home in our hearts. The three of the Trinity are all active at the same time.

Ephesians 4:4-6 reveals the Body of Christ requires the Triune God in one Spirit, one Lord and one God. 

## Function

God is triune because He wants to dispense Himself into man. The Father, who is the source, the origin, has many riches. Whatever the Father has is the Son’s (John 16:15), and what the Son has is received by the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is transfigured to be the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reaching of the divine Trinity to man.

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

> The relationship between the Father, Son and Spirit as the Source, Element and Essence can be explained with the following example:
> 
> Suppose you have an orange, and you squeeze out all the juice and boil it down to a syrup. This concentrate can be called orange essence. Suppose you do the same for a lemon and a grapefruit. When you taste the syrup, you will say it tastes like an orange/grapefruit/lemon, you wouldn't say it tastes like "orange essence" or "orange extract." The Spirit is the essence of the Body of Christ. Without the Spirit as the essence, there is no Body of Christ. But when you touch the Spirit as the essence of the Body, you see Christ. 
>
> The element of the orange is the orange itself. But within the orange as the element there is an essence which can be extracted which makes it different from a grapefruit or lemon. Without the essence the pulp of the fruit can easily be confused to be for a different fruit.
