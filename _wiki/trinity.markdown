## Background

The **Divine Trinity** or Triune God is God Himself: the three hypostases of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit which have coexisted simultaneously from eternity to eternity. The Father, Son, and Spirit are all the same God (1 Pet. 1:2; Heb 1:8; Acts 5:3-4), as God is only one (1 Cor. 8:4; Isa 45:5), yet also three. This is a mystery which cannot be fully understood by man. Only the Father fully knows the Son and vice versa (Matt. 11:27). But actually, God is triune not for human understanding, but for the dispensing of Himself into man as life that the Body of Christ may be built up as His expression and enlargement.

## Importance

The Trinity is the framework of the Bible and is indispensible for its understanding. Many genuine Christians as well as theologians are subconsciously tritheistic in their understanding of the Trinity.  One's experience and gaining of Christ cannot surpass their knowledge and revelation of Christ (Phil. 3:8). 

## Characteristics

### Coexistence

The three of the Trinity coexist simultaneously from eternity to eternity. This means that the Father, the Son and the Spirit are God and exist eternally.

| Hypostasis | Being God | Being Eternal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Father |  | Isaiah 9:6 says "eternal Father." |
| Son | John 1:1 says that the Word, the Son was God. Acts 20:28 says that God obtained the church through His own blood showing that the Son possessing flesh and blood is God Himself. | John 1:1-2 says that the Word was in the beginning with God. Hebrews 7:3 shows that the Son of God is without father and mother, having neither beginning of days nor end of life. Furthermore, the very existence of an eternal Father implies an eternal Son, since a father is only so because he has a son. |
| Spirit | | Hebrews 9:14 says "eternal Spirit." |



### Coinherence

The three of the Trinity coexist by coinhering, that is to mutually indwell one another and to exist as One. This is the divine incorporation of God and man.

### Oneness

The three of the Trinity are actually just plainly One and the same in their nature and being, inseparable yet distinct. Verses in the Old Testament explicitly indicate that there is one God (Isa. 45:5; Psa. 86:10).  

Furthermore, the hypostases of the Trinity are identified with each other. Isaiah 9:6 identifies the Son with the Father, and John 10:30 says the Son and Father are One. 2 Corinthians 3:17 identifies the Son with the Spirit. Acts 8:16 identifies the Lord Jesus with the entire Triune God when cross referenced with Matthew 28:19.


### Cooperation

Every significant operation of God's economy includes the three of the Trinity.

In the beginning in Genesis, God's intention is revealed in His creation of man, as well as His person. In the New Testament, it is clear that God is triune, and the purpose behind the Trinity is revealed. Even in the first verse of the Bible ("In the beginning, God created..."), we see a Triune God. The Hebrew word used for God *elohim* is grammatically plural, while the verb for created is singular. The fact that God is love also implies a plurality. Love requires both a subject and an object; the object of God the Father's love is the Son.

Genesis 1:2-3 following the first verse which reveals the Father then reveals the rest of the Triune God. The Spirit of God was explicitly stated to be brooding on the waters (Gen. 1:2). In verse three, God *said*, "Let there be light." God's word here implies the Son, who is the Word (John 1:1). Every operation of God is Triune - why did God need to say anything to create light? He had to create by the Son as the active instrument for everything to come into being.

In Genesis 1:26 when creating man, God says let *Us* make man in our image. This is also not the only time that the plural pronoun *Us* is used to refer to God (Isa. 6:8; Gen. 3:22; 11:7).

God as the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob also implies the Trinity as the Father, Son and Spirit. God called Abraham as the Father. Isaac as the son of Abraham inherited all that his father had and accomplished the will of his father. Jacob experienced a great work of transformation which corresponds to the transformative work of the Spirit.

In Matthew 12:18, the Lord Jesus casts out demons by the Spirit of God. Then, the kingdom that comes is not the kingdom of the son, but the kingdom of God. Then, in 28:19, baptism is in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

Luke 15 TODO

John 14:10-11 reveals the the Son is in the Father and the Son is in the Father. Furthermore, the Son not only does not speak from His own words, but it's actually the Father's working. There is one manifest action of the Son speaking, but in that action there are multiple operations: the speaking the Son and the working of the Father. There is a distinction in Persons and a distinction in operations but the manifest action is one.

John 14:16-17 says:

>I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality

This proves that the Father, Son, and Spirit all exist simultaneously, as the Son is able to ask the Father to send the Spirit.

2 Corinthians 13:14 speaks of the grace of Christ the Son, the love of God the Father, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. Love, grace, and fellowship are three items of one things; fellowship is the transmission of grace, and grace is the expression of love. 

In Ephesians 1:3, God the Father blessed us *in Christ*. 

Ephesians 3:14-17 says:

>That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love

Here the Father is granting us to be strengthened through His Spirit that Christ would make his home in our hearts. The three of the Trinity are all active at the same time.

Ephesians 4:4-6 reveals the Body of Christ requires the Triune God in one Spirit, one Lord and one God. 

## Function

God is triune because He wants to dispense Himself into man. 

The Father, who is the source, the origin, has many riches. Whatever the Father has is the Sonâ€™s (John 16:15), and what the Son has is received by the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is transfigured to be the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reaching of the divine Trinity to us.
