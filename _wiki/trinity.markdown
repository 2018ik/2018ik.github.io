## Background

The Divine Trinity is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit which have coexisted simultaneously from eternity to eternity. The Father, Son, and Spirit are all the same God (1 Pet. 1:2; Heb 1:8; Acts 5:3-4), as God is only one (1 Cor. 8:4; Isa 45:5), yet also three. This is a mystery which we cannot understand with our mind. Actually, the purpose of the Divine Trinity is not for human understanding, but for the dispensing of God into man.

## Biblical  Basis

### Plurality

Even in the first verse of the Bible, we see a Triune God. The Hebrew word used for God *elohim* is grammatically plural, while the verb for created is singular.

### Coexistence

John 14:16-17 says:

>I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality

This proves that the Father, Son, and Spirit all exist simultaneously, as the Son is able to ask the Father to send the Spirit.

Ephesians 3:14-17 says:

>That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love

Here the Father is granting us to be strengthened through His Spirit that Christ would make his home in our hearts. The three of the trinity are all active at the same time.

Lastly, 2 Corinthians 13:14 speaks of the grace of Christ the Son, the love of God the Father, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.

## Function

God is triune because He wants to dispense Himself into man. 

The Father, who is the source, the origin, has many riches. Whatever the Father has is the Sonâ€™s (John 16:15), and what the Son has is received by the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is transfigured to be the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reaching of the divine Trinity to us. 

## Mystery

God is 3 in 1 and 1 in 3, we cannot understand this with our mind.
