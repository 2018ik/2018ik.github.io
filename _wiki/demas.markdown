## Background

**Demas** was a former co-worker of Paul who abandoned him, having loved the present age and went off to Thessalonica (2 Tim. 4:10). Although Demas no doubt initially loved the Lord and consecrated Himself to Him, he left Paul. This was likely because he saw Paul being persecuted and eventually jailed, and Demas was not able to go on by himself.
