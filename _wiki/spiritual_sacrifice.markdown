## Background

Spiritual sacrifices are offered to God by the New Testament priests (1 Pet 2:5). These differ from the Old Testament sacrifices, which were literal sacrifices and include Christ as the reality of the Old Testament types, sinners saved by the gospel (Rom. 15:16), and one's own body (Rom 12:1).

## Significance

### Christ

### Gospel

When one brings sinners to God, these are offered to God (Rom. 15:16). 

### Oneself

When one places themselves on the altar, they are fully offering themselves to God's work and count themselves as nothing. 

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

> When we offer sinners to God, as in Romans 15:16, these offerings are also gifts. If we think of it merely as a sacrifice, there is the notion that we don't exactly have the sinner's best interest in mind, since we are sacrificng them.
>
> For example, suppose there is a door to door vacuum salesman. In a sense, the goal is to present prospective customers as offerings to the vacuum corporation. If the salesman has the mindset that he is sacrificing customers to the vacuum company, and that the vacuum company is going to devour the customers' wallets and souls, he would have a hard time selling his vacuums.

> On the other hand, if he views this offering as a gift to (idk where I'm going with this)
