## Background

**Grafting** is to join the branch of a living plant with the trunk of another plant so that they both grow together. The Bible reveals that the relationship between God and man is a grafted life: divinity joined with humanity to become one life. This can be seen in Romans 11:19 which illustrates the organic union of a wild olive branch to the cultivated olive tree. Since there are two parties involved in the grafting, the Christian life is not an exchanged life but one where God mingles Himself with man to become one with man.

In a grafted life, the original life is not eliminated  but is strengthened, uplifted and enriched. The higher life should transform the lower life, discharging the negative elements and adding into it a new life. In our union with God, the negative elements of our being are killed, the divine life is imparted, and these elements are brought into resurrection to be useful to God.

## Process

God ordained all things in order to graft humanity into divinity. Only two similar lives can be grafted, therefore the human life was made in the image of God according to the likeness of God (Gen. 1:26). Then, He incarnated as the seed of David and the Shoot of righteousness so that He can be the same as we are to be grafted together (Zech. 3:8; Jer. 23:5; 33:15). In order for two branches to be grafted, they must both be cut. Christ was cut first when He died on the cross, becoming the life-giving Spirit to enter into man. At this point, the divine life was brought into a man, Jesus, and this man's humanity was brought into divinity through resurrection, and this divinity can now be added into all of us as the life-giving Spirit. When we receive this Spirit by repenting, we are cut and joined to God.

## Example

Suppose there is a wild olive tree growing in a region where nuclear testing occurred, so various toxic chemicals were mingled with the soil. And it also has terrible weather. And then you cut off a branch, and grafted it into a the world's best cultivated olive tree taken care of by the world's best gardener with the best weather. All of the history of the cultivated olive tree will become the history of the branch that is grafted into this tree. When we were regenerated, we were put into an organic union with the incarnated, crucified, resurrected and ascended Lord. But why is it that so little of His history is my subjective practical experience? This is because we don't live sufficiently in our organic union with the Lord. The reality of this organic union is our mingled spirit. The practicality in which we are joined to the Lord is nothing less than our mingled spirit. Our human spirit born up, joined to and indwelled by the Spirit of Jesus Christ. As long as we live in our mingled spirit we will realize that in our very experience His history has become our history and that all that the Lord has passed through in His process of incarnation, living, death and resurrection are made more and more real to us.
