## Background

The unit of salvation is the household. When the Lord called us, He called our entire household.Our aspiration and prayer should be that our household would serve God. 

## Biblical Basis

### Noah

God only found favor in the eyes of Noah; not much was spoken about the other family members. However, as for entering into the ark, the Lord called Noah and his whole household. We can't change society, but it is our responsibility to bring our children and relatives into the ark. See 1 Peter 3:20.

### Obed-edom

When the ark relocated to the house of Obed-edom, Jehovah blessed him *and all his household*. 

### Centurion

John 4:53

### Zaccheus

Salvation came to the entire house, not just to Zaccheus.

### Some prison guard?

(Acts 16:31)

### Husband and Wife

One in the household is able to sanctify the whole family

### Aaron

The blessing of the priesthood was given to Aaron and all his descendants.

## Practice

When a young one wants to be baptized, that is good. But it is better to talk to their parents as well, that they may at least know that their child is being baptized. In this way, the whole household could eventually be saved.

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

> One sister loved the Lord very much, but her husband was not saved. So she really went to the Lord and prayed, "How come I've been married to this man for so many years, but he is still not saved?" This husband, his cousin, and relatives were all saved, just not him. So she went to the Lord. Then she shared that after much fellowship with the Lord, the Lord showed her something: the reason that her husband was not saved is that her husband does not have a wife. 
> 
> In name, he has a wife, but she goes out early in the morning at 5 for morning revival and then goes to sleep early before her husband is back home because of his business. So her husband really doesn't have a wife. She was so touched by this; she felt like throughout all these years, because of her zeal for the Lord, she had neglected her husband. 
> 
> So she began preparing meals, waiting for her husband, even though they had a maid doing stuff, but she began taking over some of those responsibilities. And within a few months, the husband believed in the Lord. When we claim this household salvation, we need to also go to the Lord very much to seek after the Lord as to why part of your household is not saved or part of your household is not in the church life. We need to go and deal with the Lord so that the Lord would be able to fulfill this promise of household salvation.

### Testimony #2

>My family used to be Buddhists for generations. One time, my grandfather was a little bit different from the grandfathers of his days: he decided to send my aunt, the older sister of my father, to a Methodist missionary school, where she got saved dynamically. After she got saved, she came home and preached to her mother, my grandmother, and she got saved. My grandmother testified to us that in the past, she served many gods and worshipped many gods - the god of trees, the god of doors, the god of the stove. She even had to sacrifice things to them because they were jealous of one another. Finally, after she was saved, she was free from all of this. After she was free, she recognized that for her to go on as a believer is not good enough, so she preached to my grandfather. Then he got saved, and together they saved almost the whole village. 
>
>They really gave themselves to the Lord, and the Lord was willing to fulfill His promise. My mom got married to my father, and my grandmother would spend many months trying to save my mom. Grace is given to us not just for us to enjoy - of course, we need to enjoy - but it is even given to us so that we can announce the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel. And we have to start this from our own family, from our own household.
