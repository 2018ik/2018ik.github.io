## Background

Exercise of the spirit is simply to use the spirit to do things. When one has an exercised spirit, death and sin is washed away.

## The Secret

The secret to the exercise of the spirit is actually an exercised will. Exercising the spirit is a choice.  

## Walking

Walking by the spirit, as opposed to living by the spirit, has the sense of carrying things out. One should learn to walk by the spirit in small matters first, say, how one talks or dresses. Then, the large matters will be settled organically.
