## Background

 A **letter of Christ** is someone who is inscribed with the Spirit of the living God in their hearts (2 Cor. 3:2-3). Letters contain intelligible words, thus, letters of Christ are expressed, read and known by others. The ink used for inscribing is the "Spirit of the living God." Since Christ operates as the Spirit, the contents of this ink must be Christ. Ministers of Christ are those who inscribe Christ as the Spirit in peoples' hearts, that they would become letters. 

 In a sense, the bride in Revelation 22:17 is the culmination of the inscription of the Spirit to produce people as the living letter of Christ as the masterpiece (poem) of God (Eph. 2:10).

## Old Testament Typology

### Speaking

>My heart overflows with a good
matter; / I speak what I have composed concerning the King. / My tongue is the pen of a ready writer

\- Psa. 45:1

To speak for Christ is to write Him on others' hearts. One's mouth speaks forth good things of God's economy.

### Law of Life

The true fulfillment of Jeremiah 31:33 which says "I will put my law in their inward parts and write it upon their hearts" is the inscribing of the law of life in the New Testament believers' hearts (Rom. 8:2).
