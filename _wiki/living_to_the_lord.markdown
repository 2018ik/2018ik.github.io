## Background

**Living to the Lord** is to take the Lord as the aim of one's living as a result of being constrained by the Lord's love. When we love someone, we are willing to go through a lot for their enjoyment; thus those who live to the Lord have the motive to please Him (2 Cor. 5:9). Living to the Lord implies we are the Lord's possession and that we belong to Him, and is deeper than living *for* the Lord which implies that we are still our own and according to our pleasure and convenience. 

Living to the Lord is in contrast to living to oneself, which is what one does by default (Rom. 14:7). It is also in contrast to walking according to the flesh, and equal to walking according to the spirit (Rom. 8:4). Those who are in the world live to their self which is the flesh expressed.

## Biblical Basis

In 2 Corinthians 5:14-15 and Romans 14:8, Paul does not tell them to live for, by, or with the Lord. He tells them to live *to* the Lord. Romans 14:8 also shows that living to the Lord is related to being the Lord's possession - "we *are* the Lord's." This indicates that those who live to the Lord see that they belong to the Lord.
