## Background

**Christ's death** accomplished an all-inclusive death which includes His redemptive death and His life-releasing death. Not only did His death accomplish redemption and terminate the old creation (Rom. 6:6), but also released the divine life as the basic factor of God's new creation. This is signified by the piercing of His side, where blood and water flowed out (John 19:34). When Christ was being crucified, His physical body was dying, but His spirit was being made alive. While believers have no part in His redemptive death, they very much have a part in his death for its release of life for the producing of the new creation and building the Body, the church (2 Cor. 5:14-17; Col. 1:24). 

## Significance

If one wants Christ's life to be unhindered in its spread, they must experience the breaking of the cross - the killing death of Christ - so that obstacles within their being can be dealt with. This includes any desires or aspirations which are not Christ Himself, even good things such as building up our virtues or zealousness for the gospel. This also includes hypocrisy, rebellion and one's natural capabilities.

## History

### Crucified

The dialogue between the Son on the cross with the Father is in parallel to the dialogue between Abraham and God when he was bringing Isaac to be sacrificed.

While Christ was on the cross, rulers and authorities were working to frustrate His work, however these evil forces were stripped off and put to shame (Col. 2:15).

### Response

Mary and the disciples wept when the Lord died on the cross. However, they rejoiced when seeing the Lord when He appeared to them on the evening of resurrection. Comparing this to John 16:21, it makes sense to think that childbirth begins with sorrow (i.e. dying on the cross) and results in joy (bringing forth the child). However turning sorrow to joy is not the main point here. The resurrection of Christ is not just to bring joy, it was a new birth, bringing divinity into humanity. We as the believers were also raised up together with Him. The entire old creation is now in a tomb. Satan belongs there, the old man belongs there, the world belongs there, all separating ordinances, death, evil angels belong there. When He resurrected, He only resurrected with God's elect. We need to see that what was raised was the one new man composed of Christ as the head and the believers as His body. We need to see the new man was created on the cross, we know that because Ephesians 2:15 says the Lord Jesus created the one new man in Himself; the Jews and the gentiles were created in Christ into the one new man. But it was in resurrection that John 16 testifies that was the bringing forth, the birth of the one new man. Satan trembles at the thought that the one new man was created on the cross and brought forth in resurrection.

This one new man is the fulfillment of Genesis 1:26. This one new man is a corporate God man, bearing God's image and exercising God's dominion to deal with God's enemy.
