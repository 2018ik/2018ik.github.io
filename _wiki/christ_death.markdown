## Background

Christ's death has a redemptive aspect and a life-releasing aspect. This is signified by the piercing of His side, where blood and water flowed out.

## Significance

If one wants Christ's life to be unhindered in its spread, they must experience the breaking of the cross - the killing death of Christ - so that obstacles within their being can be dealt with. This includes any desires or aspirations which are not Christ Himself, even good things such as building up our virtues or zealousness for the gospel. This also includes hypocrisy, rebellion and one's natural capabilities.
