## Background

In Ephesians 6:12 we see our war is not against flesh and blood, but against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies. In Matthew 12:26, we see that Satan has a kingdom. Likewise, God also has a kingdom (Rom 14:17). The war between these two forces is currently going on in our daily lives. 

## God's Kingdom

### The Church

We see in Matthew 16:18 that the Lord will build His universal church, and that the gates of Hades, which is Satan's authority, cannot prevail against it. The church is a sphere in which God can reign on the Earth today, and by expanding this sphere, He can destroy Satan.

This however is the genuine church built by Christ upon the revelation concerning Him as the rock, with stones such as Peter and all the believers as transformed human beings. 

## Satan's Kingdom

### Authority of Darkness

Satan's kingdom exercises the authority of darkness, which denotes the authority of Satan in contrast with God, who is light. This is also called the authority of evil in the heavenlies, in the air (Eph. 6:12). Satan rules over the world (John 12:31) with his subordinates as principalities, powers, and rulers of the darkness of this world (Eph. 6:12).

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

> So we have the genuine church built on top of the rock, which is Christ. By the same verse 16:18, the gates of Hades will not prevail against the church. We see two parties here: the gates of Hades, and the church. The gates of hades refer to Satan's authority on the Earth, that is Satan's kingdom. We in see Matthew 12:26 that Satan has kingdom. And it's here right now on the Earth, ruling over the majority of the world's population. On the other side, we are all familiar with God's kingdom on the Earth today, that is the church. 
>
>There is a constant warfare going on between these two kingdoms - not of flesh and blood, but against the authority of evil in the heavenlies, in the air. The attacks against the church, and against Christians, even physical attacks, are behind the scenes worked out by the authority of Satan. When we preach the gospel to someone and they are completely closed off, even attacking us or accusing us, this is altogether incited by the authority of evil.
>
>This war has no neutral ground, we too can succumb to the satanic power of darkness, or we can build ourselves into the genuine church, which the gates of hades cannot prevail against. This church is a corporate entity. We cannot prevail against Satan as an individual. Spiritual warfare is not an individual matter. Lord, give us such a vision, that we can see and participate in this spiritual warfare. By entering into the reality of the body of christ we can prevail; Lord, you have already won the victory, make this victory so real to us in our daily living.
