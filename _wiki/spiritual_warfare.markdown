## Background

In Ephesians 6:12 we see our war is not against flesh and blood, but against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies. In Matthew 12:26, we see that Satan has a kingdom. Likewise, God also has a kingdom (Rom 14:17). The war between these two forces is currently going on in our daily lives. 

## God's Kingdom

### The Church

We see in Matthew 16:18 that the Lord will build His universal church, and that the gates of Hades, which is Satan's authority, cannot prevail against it. The church is a sphere in which God can reign on the Earth today, and by expanding this sphere, He can destroy Satan.

This however is the genuine church built by Christ upon the revelation concerning Him as the rock, with stones such as Peter and all the believers as transformed human beings. 

## Satan's Kingdom

### Authority of Darkness

Satan's kingdom exercises the authority of darkness, which denotes the authority of Satan in contrast with God, who is light. This is also called the authority of evil in the heavenlies, in the air (Eph. 6:12). Satan rules over the world (John 12:31) with his subordinates as principalities, powers, and rulers of the darkness of this world (Eph. 6:12).
