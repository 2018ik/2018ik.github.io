## Background

Paul was uniquely prepared by the Lord through his background and experiences to reveal the church in a full way.

In the 14 epistles of Paul we see the three words: ME, JESUS, VESSEL.

## History

### Conversion

Paul's conversion is recorded three separate times in Acts. 

#### Acts 9

At this point, Paul was breathing "threatening and murder against the disciples" (Acts 9:1). Eventually, the voice out of heaven said "why are you persecuting Me?" The disciples were actually part of the Body of Christ, so Paul's threatening against the disciples was a persecution toward Christ. 

Here, Paul addressed the voice as "Lord" as he thought he was serving God. The voice then replied with "I am *Jesus*." Paul saw that Jesus is Lord and passed through the process of incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension for the producing and building up of the Body of Christ. Here Paul sees that the Triune God and the believers are one (Acts 9:5).

He also sees that man is a tripartite vessel to contain and be filled with Christ as life (Acts 9:15).

#### Acts 22

Paul speaking to Jewish people

#### Acts 26

Paul speaking to king Agrippa. In this particular account, he said he saw a light from heaven *at mid-day beyond the brightness of the sun* shining around me and those journeying with me. The Lord also gave Paul a more detailed commission here: to appoint you as a minister and a witness both of things in which you *have* seen Me and of the things in which  *will* appear to you (Acts 26:16).

We need to open our eyes to progress to see more day by day (Acts 26:18).

>"Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision"

\- Acts 26:19

The Lord's Recovery is not about following a particular person - it is about following the heavenly vision.

The king says afterwards that much learning must have been driving Paul insane; regardless, Paul then tries to preach the gospel to the king. Then Agrippa rage-quit and left the scene, stating that Paul had not done anything wrong.

## Governed by the Spirit

Paul was governed by whether or not he had rest in his spirit (2 Cor. 2:13).

## Completing Ministry

Paul says that he was commissioned to complete the word of God; this means to complete the revelation of God, which without Paul's writings would be incomplete. (Col 1:25)

The central vision of this ministry is God in us as our contents ("vessel"), Christ as the mystery of God ("Jesus"), and the church as the mystery of Christ ("Me").

The Lord's recovery is the recovery of this central vision.
