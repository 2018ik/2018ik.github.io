## Background

The **children of Israel** were descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob which Jehovah promised to bring into the good land.

## Significance

The history of the children of Israel is a picture and an example of the Christian journey (1 Cor. 10:1-11). God called the children of Israel out of Egypt (the world) that they would enter into the promised land (the all-inclusive Christ) to enjoy its riches so that they may establish God's kingdom and expression of earth (Exo. 3:8).

## History

### Called Out

The children of Israel were held captive in Egypt, which signifies the world, under the reign of Pharaoh, who signifies Satan. Through the passover, signifying the redemption of Christ, the children of Israel were led out of Egypt by Moses. Then, they passed through the Red Sea, which signifies baptism.

### Wandering

After the Israelites received the law and the revelation of God's dwelling place, the tabernacle, nearly all fell and died in the wilderness, failing to reach this goal (Heb. 3:16-19). Although today's believers are redeemed by Christ and brought into the revelation of God's economy, they can still fail to fulfill this calling. The goal of this calling is to enter into the possession of the good land, which is Christ, and enjoy His riches to build up the expression of God on earth today.

### Entering the Good Land

The children of Israel did not believe that God could give them the good land, due to the Anakim race of giants which was present. However, Joshua proclaimed that the Anakim was their bread (Num. 14:9). The often seemingly insurmountable obstacles a Christian encounters is actually their food. Every difficulty and temptation from Satan is food which God appoints that can be eaten for spiritual progress.
