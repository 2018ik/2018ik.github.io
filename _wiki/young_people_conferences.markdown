## Background

Young people's conferences refers to conferences held specifically for middle school to college-aged individuals. These are not just for doctrinal teaching, and the speaking of a few, but requires good coordination and labor by all. While the Lord supplies, His many stewards i.e. serving ones must distribute Him to the students (Mark 6:37), that they may gain a solid deposit each time they come together (2 Tim. 1:14).

## Roles

### Speaking Ones

### Serving Ones

The serving ones are actually more important than the speakers, as the young people will actively converse with, and spend the majority of their time with the serving ones.

Those serving should pray at all times for those under their care (Eph. 1:16), as well as for the speaking and atmosphere (Acts 6:4). Prior the conference, carpooling with the young people allows for an organic way to establish a personal relationship with them. During the conference, the serving ones can observe those whom they care for during the meetings and group times, as well as speak to them privately.

### Young People

The young people should have the goal to have a real touch with the Lord during these conferences. 

It is OK for the young people to be distracted, but they should not distract others.
