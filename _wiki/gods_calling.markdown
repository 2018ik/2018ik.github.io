## Background

**God's calling** refers to God revealing Himself to those whom he predestined to call them out of the world that they may be saved (Rom. 8:30).

## Significance

## Walking Worthily of God's Calling

As those called by God, we must walk worthily of this calling (Eph. 4:1). Based on the context, this would be to:

1. Keep the oneness of the Spirit
2. Grow up into Christ as the Head
3. Learn Christ as the reality that is in Jesus
4. Live in love and light
5. Live by being filled in Spirit to overflow with Christ.
