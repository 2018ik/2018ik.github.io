## Background

**Perfecting** is the growth in life of the believers with an emphasis on functioning for the building up of the Body of Christ. This is carried out by the [gifted members](../gifts), who perfect the saints unto the work of the ministry (Eph. 4:11-12). God wants not only to save all men, but to bring them to the full knowledge of the truth (1 Tim. 2:4).
