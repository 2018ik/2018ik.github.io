## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>If you would ask me what is the most practical lesson I have learned in all these years I would say that it is to repent by turning my mind back to the Lord all the time. Much news may come to us with criticism, opposition, and many such matters; all these things serve only to distract us from the Lord. We must learn to always turn our mind to the Lord. In the morning we must repent. At noon we must repent. And in the evening we must repent again. We must repent all the time.
