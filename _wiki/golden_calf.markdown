## Background

The golden calf was an idol made by the children of Israel. 

Idolatry is Satan's usurping of what God has given His chosen people in order to make it a waste. The children of Israel had received gold from Egypt for the building of the tabernacle, God's house, but they instead used it to build a golden calf.

## Corinthians

In 1 Corinthians, Paul said that the Israelites became idolaters, sitting down to eat and drink and standing up to play. To *play* here implies a lack of seriousness, and with the intention to have fun. This is in contrast to real enjoyment of Christ.
