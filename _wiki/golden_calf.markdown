## Background

The golden calf was an idol made by the children of Israel (Exo. 32:1-6). 

Idolatry is Satan's usurping of what God has given His chosen people in order to make it a waste. The children of Israel had received gold from Egypt for the building of the tabernacle, God's house, but they instead used it to build a golden calf.
