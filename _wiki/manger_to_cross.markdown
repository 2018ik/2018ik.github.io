## Background

The manger to cross represents the living of Jesus as the first God-man. The Lord chose this type of life, humbling himself even unto death. 

## Timeline

### Manager

A baby in a manger signifies smallness and lowliness, which set the direction for the rest of the Man-Savior's life (Luke 2:12).

### Fleeing

Jesus fled from Israel to Egypt (Matt. 2:1-15), and from Egypt back to Israel (Matt. 2:16-21), then from Bethlehem to Galilee and settled in Nazareth (Matt. 2:22-23). This was an insignificant and despised village. We should be trained to flee the world, with all of its material riches, but not in the way of asceticism.

### Circumcised

Jesus was circumised on the eigth day (Luke 2:21-24) which signifies the putting off of the flesh and the consecration to be sanctified.

### Growth

Jesus grew to be strong and filled with wisdom and grace (Luke 2:40). He also cared about the things of the Father's house when he was twelve (Luke 2:49). This is to know and care about God's economy.
