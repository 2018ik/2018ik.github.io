## Background

**Free will** is God's principle in creating man that they would have the freedom to choose Him. Since the beginning, God placed man in front of two trees: the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Gen. 2:9; 2:16-17). 

## Significance

That God desired man to choose Him out of his own free will explains many questions regarding God's economy. The reason why He does not instantly destroy Satan, and the reason why He does not simply give man eternal life, is that His heart's desire is for man to choose Him voluntarily.
