## Background

## Old Testament Canon

The Old Testament canonization began at the time of Ezra and took more than 400 years before it was completed at the beginning of the New Testament age.

## Council of Nicaea

This council was assembled by Constantine the Great in A.D. 325, when Christianity had become greatly influential in regions around te Mediterranean. There was divisions regarding the truth, so Constantine's goal of achieving unity in the Roman Empire required achieving a religious unity. 

## Council of Carthage

In A.D. 397 this council in North Africa affirmed the seven books of Hebrews, James, 2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude and Revelation as part of the New Testament.

## Reformation

## Inner Life

God raised up some from the Catholic church who emphasized the inner life, such as Madame Guyon, who continued to recover elements of the experience of life.
