## Background

## Old Testament Canon

The Old Testament canonization began at the time of Ezra and took more than 400 years before it was completed at the beginning of the New Testament age.

## Council of Nicaea

This council was assembled by Constantine the Great in A.D. 325, when Christianity had become greatly influential in regions around te Mediterranean. There was divisions regarding the truth, so Constantine's goal of achieving unity in the Roman Empire required achieving a religious unity. 

## Council of Carthage

In A.D. 397 this council in North Africa affirmed the seven books of Hebrews, James, 2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude and Revelation as part of the New Testament.

## ??

Gradually, the church began to lose many truths and gain many false teachings. By the 1300s, nearly everything had been lost and the so-called church at this time picked up many heretical and sinful things. There were some faithful saints during this time, but there is a reason why this period is called the Dark Ages. For the most part, they had no God.

## Reformation

At the beginning of the 1500s, Martin Luther recovered justification by faith.

## Brethren

Many of today's fundamental theology is based on Brethren teachings by John Nelson Darby, Benjamin Newton, C.H. Mackintosh, William Kelley, etc. Unfortunately, the Brethren were distracted away from life by teachings and failed to be one [in a general way](../speciality_generality_practicality#generality), and therefore spawned hundreds of divisions.

## Inner Life

God raised up some from the Catholic church who emphasized the inner life, such as Madame Guyon, who continued to recover elements of the experience of life.
