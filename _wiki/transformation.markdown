## Background

**Transformation** is the inward metabolic process in which God works to spread His divine life and nature into every part of one's being - spirit, soul and body (particularly the soul). As in any metabolic process, a new element is brought in to replace an old element which is discharged. Transformation is the issue and working out of renewing, and is for the building up of the Body of Christ.

Transformation is not a perceptible outward change in behavior, but an inward change in essence. Someone who is sickly can change their outward appearance with makeup, but actually by eating healthy food, gradually over time there will be the outward expression. As someone is transformed, there is a gradual change in the way they dress and act as a spontaneous result of their inward change in life and nature. Transformation can also be seen in the gradual petrification of wood. Petrified wood over hundreds of thousands of years has all of its wood element removed from it and a new stone element is added in its place.

In organic salvation, transformation follows renewing and precedes conformation. Furthermore, transformation precedes maturity in life.

## Significance

The building up of the church requires the proper material, that is gold, silver and precious stones (1 Cor. 3:12) which requires transformation. Each member of the Body of Christ is being transformed into same image as God to build up the Body of Christ (2 Cor. 3:18), which consummates the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:12-21).

## Biblical Basis

In Romans 12:2, transformation is through the renewing of the mind. In 2 Corinthians 3:18, believers are transformed into the image of the Son of God. This is the transformation of the soul, the inner being. Philippians 3:21 refers to the transformation or transfiguration of the body. 

Key verses:

>And do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and well pleasing and perfect.

\-Rom. 12:2

>But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.

\-2 Cor. 3:18 

## Metabolism

The change in which the Lord is carrying out is through the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Christ, which comes with new elements, which thereby discharges the old elements. This is a big replacement, but this does not mean [our entire being is replaced](../exchanged_life). Transformation is the discharge of only the fallen part of one's being, but keeps the [part created and redeemed by God](../tripartite#created-life). If one attempts to correct themselves, there is no new element infused into them, and therefore it cannot be considered a real transformation.
