## Background

**Transformation** is the inward metabolic process through which God works to spread His divine life and nature into every part of a human being - spirit, soul and body (particularly the soul). This dispensing of the Triune God into members of Christ is for the building up of the Body of Christ.

Transformation is not a perceptible outward change in behavior, but an inward change in essence. Someone who is sickly can change their outward appearance with makeup, but actually by eating healthy food, gradually over time there will be the outward expression. As someone is transformed, there is the gradual change in the way they dress and act *as a spontaneous result* of their inward change in disposition.

Transformation can also be seen in the petrification of wood. Petrified wood looks the same as it once was, but it has been completely replaced by stone. 

## Significance

The building up of the church requires the proper material, that is gold, silver and precious stones (1 Cor. 3:12) which requires transformation. Each member of the Body of Christ is being transformed into same image as God to build up the Body of Christ (2 Cor. 3:18), which consummates the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:12-21).

## Biblical Basis

Romans 12:2
2 Cor. 3:18

## Steps

Washing of regeneration

Sanctification of the spirit

## Metabolism

The change in which the Lord is carrying out is through the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Christ, which comes with new elements, which thereby discharges the old elements. If one attempts to correct themselves, there is no new element infused into them, and therefore it cannot be considered a real transformation.
