## Background

**Joy** is an attribute of God as the God of enjoyment (Rom. 15:13). The joy of God is the strength of the believers (Neh. 8:10). Anyone who takes God as their exceeding joy will be persecuted (TODO). A psalmist stated that God was their exceeding joy (Psa. 43:4). The Christian life and church life should be lived with joy. 

## Aspects

### Strength

The joy of the Lord is strength (Neh. 8:10). Everyone is strong in their own way, however one's natural strength must be set aside for the joy of God. Believers should not be strength conscious, but joy conscious.
