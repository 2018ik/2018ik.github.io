>And He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him [to be] Head over all things to the church,

\- Eph. 1:22

## Background

**Transmitted** is all that God is in Christ transmitted to the church. The word *to* in Ephesians 1:22 implies a transmission, indicating that whatever Christ has attained and obtained is transmitted to the church.

## Electricity

Electricity comes from the generator but the application of the electricity is bit by bit, not all at once. No lightbulb can take all the electricity in the grid at the same time. In the same way with us, we enjoy the Lord's transmission, but the transmission from the Lord is bit by bit.
