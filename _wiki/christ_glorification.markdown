## Background

**Christ's glorification** was accomplished through His death and resurrection, where the divine life was released from the shell of His humanity (John 17:1; 12:23-24). In incarnation, the glory of God which the Son had in eternity past was hidden within the human body of Jesus (John 17:5). This glory was manifested after death and resurrection,  [designated](../christ_designation) the firstborn Son of God.

The issue of Christ's glorification was the accomplishment of the three items in the stage of inclusion so that the believers can be brought into a divine incorporation with the consummated Triune God (John 14:16-20).

## Biblical Basis

When Jesus speaks regarding His glorification in the Gospels, it is clear that He is speaking of His death and resurrection. In John 12:23 prior to His crucifixion, He says that "hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified." Then in verse 24, He says that the grain of wheat must fall into the ground and die in order to bear fruit, pointing very clearly to His death. Thus, to be glorified He must die (fall into the ground)  and resurrect (bear much fruit). Verse 28 says that the Father's name has been glorified and will be glorified again. The first past tense glorified refers to the embodiment of His glory in the Son in incarnation, and the second future tense glorify refers to Christ's glorification through death and resurrection.

In Luke 12:49-50, the Lord says He has come to cast fire on the earth, and that He has to be baptized. Neither of these things had occurred at this point, and He wished the fire would  be kindled, and He was pressed to accomplish the baptism. This does not refer to His initial baptism in water by John as that had already occurred, but a further baptism by literally dying and resurrecting. The fire here refers to the impulse of spiritual life; you could say that since the Lord's resurrection, the first of the gospel has been cast to the entire earth. This is the same fire of the seven Spirits.

Luke 24:26 says that Christ had to suffer death in order to enter into glory. 

In Acts 3:13-15, Peter explicitly states that Jesus was glorified by the Father, having been delivered to Pilate, killed, and raised from the dead. Likewise, in John 7:39 when the Lord says the Spirit was not yet, as He had not yet been glorified, this refers to the Spirit not being compounded into the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit in resurrection (1 Cor. 15:43-45)
