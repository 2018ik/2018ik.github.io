## Background

**Christ's glorification** was accomplished through His death and resurrection, where the divine life was released from the shell of His humanity (John 17:1; 12:23-24). In incarnation, the glory of God was hidden within the human body of Jesus. This glory was manifested after death and resurrection

The issue of Christ's glorification was the incorporation of the consummated Triune God with the regenerated believers (John 14:16-20).

## Biblical Basis

When Jesus speaks regarding His glorification, He is speaking of His death and resurrection. In John 12:23 prior to His crucifixion, He says that "hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified." Then, He says that the grain of wheat must fall into the ground and die in order to bear fruit, pointing very clearly to His death (John 12:24). Thus, to be glorified He must die (fall into the ground)  and resurrect (bear much fruit). In verse 28, when the Father says that the Father's name has been glorified and will be glorified again, this refers first to the embodiment of His glory in the Son in incarnation, and then to the glorification through death and resurrection.

In Luke 12:49-50, the Lord says He has come to cast fire on the earth, and that He has to be baptized. Neither of these things had occurred at this point, and He wishes the fire has been kindled, and He is pressed to accomplish the baptism. This does not refer to His initial baptism in water by John, but a further baptism by literally dying and resurrecting. Luke 24:26 reveals that Christ had to suffer death in order to enter into glory.

In Acts 3:13-35, Peter explicitly states that Jesus was glorified by the Father, having been delivered to Pilate, killed, and raised from the dead. Likewise, in John 7:39 when the Lord says the Spirit was not yet, as He had not yet been glorified, this refers to the Spirit not being compounded into the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit in resurrection (1 Cor. 15:43-45)
