## Background

**Christ's glorification** was accomplished through His death and resurrection, where the divine life was released from the shell of His humanity (John 17:1; 12:23-24). The issue of Christ's glorification was the incorporation of the consummated Triune God with the regenerated believers (John 14:16-20).
