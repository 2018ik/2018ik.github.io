## Background

To **labor** is to exercise the spirit to gain portions of the all-inclusive Christ, typified by the good land of Canaan. The proper Christian life is to labor on Christ everyday to produce not only the portion which satisfies themselves, but also the surplus which can be brought to the meetings for a rich exhibition of Christ.
