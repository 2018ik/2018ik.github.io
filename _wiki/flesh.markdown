## Background

The **flesh** in the Bible is almost always negative, and usually refers to the corrupted, sinful body produced by the fall of man. For example, the flesh is weak (Matt. 24:41; Rom. 6:19), and nothing good dwells in the flesh (Rom. 7:18). When someone is in the flesh, they work out sins (Rom. 7:5; Gal. 5:19-21) and cannot fulfill the righteous requirements of the law (Rom. 8:4) or please God (Rom. 8:8). The flesh the body of sin mentioned in Romans 6:6 and the body of death mentioned in Romans 7:24 is only good for sin and death. This sinful body is also called the old man, however the old man is objective while the flesh is subjective. This "old man" is an intangible aspect of man; the flesh can only be crucified in the spiritual sense (Gal. 5:24). 

On the other hand, flesh sometimes refers to the totality of fallen man, including the physical body. In Genesis 6:3, God says that man is flesh. Paul’s flesh that was afflicted in 2 Corinthians 7:5 was his physical, fallen body. 

Romans chapters 7 and 8 are related to the subjective experiences concerning the Holy Spirit and the flesh. Just as Christ is related to the Holy Spirit, so the old man is related to the flesh. Just as Christ cannot be experienced without the Holy Spirit, so also the old man cannot be experienced without the flesh. Christ is lived out in the Holy Spirit; likewise, the old man is lived out in the flesh. For example, the Bible says that our old man has been crucified with Christ.

## Relation to the Old Man

The old man and the first definition of the flesh (the corrupted, sinful body) are one and the same. Both are crucified, and both are substituted for Christ. However, crucifying the old man is done by Christ and is an objective fact (Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20), while crucifying the flesh is done by the believers themselves in their subjective experience. Galatians 5:24 says that they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts. A believer must see not only that the crucifixion of their old man has been accomplished in Christ, but also take the initiative to crucify the flesh through the Holy Spirit. This is not to invent a new cross, but to allow the Holy Spirit to apply the cross of Christ in one’s daily life. 

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

> Romans 6:6 says that the old man has been crucified with Christ that the body of sin might be annulled. Likewise, Galatians 2:20 says that the old “I” has been crucified with Christ. This is an objective fact, but even if we believe this, it will do nothing for us if it is not made real in our experience. This is the difference between these two verses and Galatians 5:24, which says that we who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh. Here, the action of crucifying is initiated by the believers; it is we who are crucifying the flesh with its passions and lusts. This indicates a definite application by the believers of the death of Christ.

>In the Bible, the old man and the flesh both refer to the same corrupt body of sin, but while the old man is objective, the flesh is subjective and is our personal living out of the old man. This section also mentions the self, which is also subjective and refers particularly to our human ideas and opinions. So despite knowing that the old man is crucified, how come we still live in the flesh and in the self, with our infinite opinions? Well, the context of Galatians 5 is to walk by the Spirit. The objective basis of the crucifixion of the old man needs to be applied subjectively by the Holy Spirit, which is in us and imparting to us resurrection life. Christ has crucified the old man, and now we have his resurrection life in us by which we can crucify the flesh and deny the self.
