## Background

The earthly ministry of Jesus refers to His ministry from birth to His second ascension. It can be summarized in 5 stages of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection and the breathing out of the Holy Spirit. 

## Incarnation

In incarnation, God became man, not just to serve as a means to communicate physically with man, or to serve as a sacrificial lamb, but to bring divinity into humanity. This was to make God one with man and man one with God in life and nature. 

## Human Living

Jesus lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years, where he performed many miracles and signs. Intrinsically however, He was expressing the divine attributes of God through His human virtues. 

## Crucifixion

Jesus died not only for our sins, but terminated the old creation (Rom. 6:6) and released the divine life from His human shell so that this life could germinate the new creation (John 12:24).

## Resurrection

Christ's resurrection was a new birth, designated the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 1:4), becoming the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), and regenerated all His believers (1 Pet. 1:3).

## Breathing Out

The Lord breathed Himself as the pneumatic Christ into His disciples, bringing the entire consummated Triune God into His believers. This Spirit mingles with the believers' spirit to become one mingled spirit (1 Cor. 6:17).
