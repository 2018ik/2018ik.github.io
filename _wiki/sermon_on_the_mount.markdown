## Background

The **sermon on the mount** was a supreme teaching given by Jesus concerning prayer.

## Significance

All must ask, seek and knock to meet the high requirements to enter into the kingdom of the heavens.

## The Lord's Prayer

Many churches today recite the prayer in Matthew 6:9-13 but do not understand its significance. This prayer is the issue of someone who lives in the kingdom of the heavens, and is accompanied by four negative charges as warnings.

First, He prays that the Father's name be sanctified. This is not a matter separate from the person praying; to sanctify the Father's name is to express Him in one's living. Only a person who lives a sanctified life - separated from being common - is able to pray such a prayer.

Next, He prays that the Father's kingdom would come. Today, Satan rules over the world (John 12:31). In this kingdom, there is no righteousness, peace or joy. However, Romans 14:1 says that the reality of the kingdom life are these three virtues in the Holy Spirit. Turning to the mingled spirit makes this kingdom of righteousness real today. This is also the Father's will, and to pray for this will to be done is to pray that God's kingdom would prevail on the earth today.

The significance of the daily bread is to pray only for today's needs. The Lord is always faithful to supply the daily necessity, and prayer must be carried out daily to receive. 

For a person to ask the Father to forgive their debts is also a matter of their living; they must likewise forgive other's debts, that there be no separating factors between them, God and others. Praying to not be brought into temptation indicates knowledge of weakness. Only the Lord is able to deliver man from Satan. 

The concluding word says "For Yours i the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen" (Matt. 6:13). This is the Triune God - the kingdom is of the Son, the power is of the Spirit, and the glory is of the Father.
