## Background

The **masterpiece** (Greek: *poeima*) of God is the church (Eph. 2:10). The Greek word *poeima* means a work of art which expresses the creator's wisdom and design, such as a poem. The church is a work of art that expresses God's wisdom and design. The heavens, earth, man, etc. are all created by God, but are not God's masterpiece. Only the church, the Body of Christ, the corporate new man is a masterpiece.
