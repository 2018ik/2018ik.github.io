## Background

According to Ephesians 2:10, the church is God's masterpiece. The Greek word, poeima, means something that has been made as in a poem. The church is a work of art that expresses God's wisdom and design.

The heavens, earth, man, etc. are all created by God, but are not God's masterpiece. Only the church, the Body of Christ, the corporate new man is a masterpiece.
