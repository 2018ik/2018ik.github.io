## Background

Believers are **captives** who are possessed by Christ and put under His power and authority. To be conscious of the fact that we are captives of Christ is to realize that we are nothing, have nothing, and can do nothing. This is consistent with the fact that as one grows in life, they become more dependent on the Lord. To act apart from Christ shows that the stubborn human will has yet to be conquered. 

## Biblical Basis

Ephesians 4:8 says that Christ led a train of vanquished foes, meaning that man, who was once God's foe, has now been vanquished and rescued from Satan's captivity.

>But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ..."

\- 2 Cor. 2:14

In 2 Corinthians 2:14, Paul uses a metaphor of a procession held in honor of a Roman general. The verb *leads* means to lead people as captives in a procession. The word *us* refers to the conquered captives - us believers who were once enemies of God. God is celebrating His triumph over the enemy by leading His redeemed captives in a procession. Paul Himself used to be one who literally fought against Christ and the church (Acts 9:1-22), but eventually he was captured to become a captive of Christ.

The epistles to the Philippians and Romans describes Paul was a slave of Christ, and 2 Peter likewise describes Peter as such. Revelation is also written to His slaves (Rev. 1:1).

## Significance

The Lord doesn't need spiritual giants, he needs little captives. We need to pray for the Lord to conquer us and to never let us win, and to defeat us all the time. Ironically in God's eternal economy, our defeat means we are winning.

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>I was going down the southwest freeway. I was there, it was a parking lot, way back many years ago. I was just stalled there, listening to a cassette tape. Brother Lee said this, we need to pray this prayer, when I heard him pray this prayer, I stopped the cassette tape and prayed it on the southwest freeway I could never forget it. It was "Lord, conquer me. Make me your captive. Never let me win. Defeat me all the time." I hope we would pray that prayer. You pray it one time the Lord will remember that. This is experiential, this is where the rubber meets the road so to speak. Yes we are His captives factually, but are we His captives experientially? We conquer Him and defeat Him all the time. We need to ask Him to defeat us all the time. If we win, and defeat the Lord, we are defeated. Our only true triumphs are Christ's triumphs over us, and that His defeats of us are our only true victories.
