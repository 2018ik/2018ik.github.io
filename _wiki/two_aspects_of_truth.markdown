## Background

This is a basic principle of studying the Bible where two facts may seemingly be contradictory (e.g. the essential and economic aspects of the Triune God) and must be examined with wisdom and revelation.

## Examples

### Child and Adult

On one hand, a Christian must mature in life and arrive as a full-grown man (Eph. 4:13), but on the other hand, one must be simplified and to long for God like a little child (1 Pet. 2:2).

### Laboring in Grace

On one hand, the Christian life is a life of sacrifice (Rom. 12:1), labor (1 Cor. 15:10), having fellowship with the Lord's sufferings and being conformed to His death (Phil. 3:10), and is related by Paul to an athletic race which must be run (1 Cor. 9:24). However, it is also a life of enjoyment (Phil 4:4) and the labor is actually light (Matt. 11:30).

Outwardly, believers must pass through suffering to be conformed to the image of Christ. However, this outward suffering is supplied by inward grace, rest, comfort, even resurrection power. Paul labored more abundantly than anyone else, but it was not him, but the grace of God which was with him (1 Cor. 15:10). Therefore, outwardly, there is labor and suffering. However, inwardly, it is Christ as the infinite supply of grace who is one with man and works through man.
