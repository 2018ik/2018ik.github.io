>"I thank my God always concerning you based upon the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus"

\- 1 Cor. 1:4

## Background

**Grace** is God in His Trinity (God the Father in the Son as the Spirit) processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection and ascension to enter into His believers through the regenerated human spirit to be their everything, especially in the matter of enjoyment. Contrary to the popular, shallow notion of grace being mere unmerited favor or material gifts from God, grace is actually God Himself becoming one's everything in a subjective way. As grace is subjective, it is only as real as one chooses to cooperate with God; attempting to follow the law to justify oneself out of natural effort actually nullifies grace (Gal. 2:21).

Technically speaking, the entire Bible can be summarized as God in the beginning, the New Jerusalem at the end, and grace in its operation to bring mankind to that ending (Rev. 22:21).

## Biblical Basis

John 1:17 reveals that grace came with Jesus Christ. Before Christ came as the embodiment of all the fulness of the Godhead (Col. 2:9) and was processed to be the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) to indwell man (Rom. 8:11), man could not enjoy God as grace. Certain figures in the Old Testament like Noah found favor with God (Gen 6:8) and God showed favor to many others. If grace was simply unmerited favor, then grace would not have come with Jesus Christ.

Furthermore, 1 Corinthians 15:10 says Paul labored more than others, but it was not Him but the grace of God which was with Him. It is not God's unmerited favor which allowed Paul to labor, but the fact that He entered into Paul to be his life and everything. This corresponds to Galatians 2:20 - the not I but Christ here corresponds to not I that labor but grace in 1 Corinthians 15:10 indicating that Christ *is* grace.

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

> We may be perplexed even frustrated how do we gain this good land? The way to gain this good land is by enjoying grace. Grace is the good land, but I would tell you the way to enjoy the good land is by grace. Yes, we have to apply all diligence we cannot be lazy we have to labor in this good land but I tell you even that labor even that labor needs grace. As we are nearing the end of the year with a new year ahead of us I hope that all of us in the recovery would look forward to a year of more gaining of christ as our good land. More experience of Christ as our good land. But I tell you we pray that way but we have to even pray this: Lord even this desire of mine to gain you I need your grace to work it out. I need your grace to strengthen me to energize me to do that.
