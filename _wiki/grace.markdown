>"I thank my God always concerning you based upon the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus"

\- 1 Cor. 1:4

## Background

**Grace** is God in His Trinity processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection and ascension to be everything to His believers, especially in enjoyment. Contrary to the popular notion of grace being mere material gifts from God, grace is God Himself becoming one's everything in a subjective way. As grace is subjective, it is only as real as one chooses to cooperate with God; attempting to follow the law to justify oneself out of natural effort actually nullifies grace (Gal. 2:21).

Technically speaking, the entire Bible can be summarized as God in the beginning, the New Jerusalem at the end, and grace in its operation to bring mankind to that ending (Rev. 22:21).

## Biblical Basis

John 1:17 reveals that grace came with Jesus Christ. Before Christ was processed to be the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) to indwell man (Rom. 8:11), man could not enjoy God as grace. Certain figures in the Old Testament like Noah found favor with God (Gen 6:8) and God showed favor to many others. If grace was simply unmerited favor, then grace would not have come with Jesus Christ.

Furthermore, 1 Corinthians 15:10 says Paul labored more than others, but it was not Him but the grace of God which was with Him. It is not God's unmerited favor which allowed Paul to labor, but the fact that He entered into Paul to be his life and everything.

### Boulder Example

The Lord's grace is our supply. When we encounter a boulder in our path, he may not necessarily remove the boulder. Instead, he may raise the water level so that we may simply float over the boulder.
