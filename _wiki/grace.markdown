>"I thank my God always concerning you based upon the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus"

\- 1 Cor. 1:4

## Background

**Grace** is Christ as everything to the believers for their enjoyment (Gal. 6:18; Phil. 4:23). [Christ as the embodiment of God as the Spirit](../processed_consummated_triune_god) is able to enter into our spirit and empower us from within. Therefore, true experience of grace is to enjoy Christ regardless of one's outward situation (2 Cor. 12:8-9). Grace is most often experienced in suffering situations which are able to expose one's shortages and bring them to God as their full supply. This is contrary to the popular, shallow notion of grace being mere unmerited favor or material gifts from God. 

When we are open to God's will and cooperate with Him, there is always a sufficient supply of grace to carry out the work. On the contrary, attempting to follow the law out of natural effort actually nullifies grace; thus, self-effort is futile and comes with no supply (Gal. 2:21).

Technically speaking, the entire Bible can be summarized as God in the beginning, the New Jerusalem at the end, and grace in its operation to bring mankind to that ending (Rev. 22:21).

## Etymology

The Greek word for grace (*χάρις*) is related to the verb *χαίρω* which means "to rejoice." Even in traditional usage by the ancient Greeks, grace is not only favor, politeness or aesthetics but also the joy which comes from those things. 

## Not Mere Unmerited Favor

Grace is often defined as God's unmerited favor in giving His people things, material or immaterial. For example, getting a better job, or working out a solution to a difficult situation. Such things can be grace, but more significantly, grace is God Himself enjoyed by man. 

John 1:17 reveals that grace came with Jesus Christ. Before Christ came as the embodiment of all the fulness of the Godhead (Col. 2:9) and was processed to be the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) to indwell man (Rom. 8:9-11), man could not enjoy God as grace. Certain figures in the Old Testament like Noah found favor with God (Gen 6:8) and God showed favor to many others. If grace was simply unmerited favor, then grace would not have come with Jesus Christ. Furthermore, the verse says the law was *given* while grace *came*. This indicates that grace is a person, whereas the law is an object. The receive the grace is thus to receive Christ as the Spirit, also known as the Spirit of grace (Heb. 10:29).

Furthermore, 1 Corinthians 15:10 says Paul labored more than others, but it was not Him but the grace of God which was with Him. It is not God's unmerited favor which allowed Paul to labor, but the fact that He entered into Paul to be his life and everything. This corresponds to Galatians 2:20 - the not I but Christ here corresponds to not I that labor but grace in 1 Corinthians 15:10 indicating that Christ *is* grace.

Grace is often associated with Christ: grace came through Jesus Christ in John 1:17, and grace is the attribute associated with Christ at the end of many of Paul's epistles (2 Corinthians 13:14; Galatians 6:18). However, grace in its ultimate form is the Spirit. As grace came through Christ so did the Spirit (John 16:13). The all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit was "not yet" prior to Christ's resurrection (John 7:39) and breathed into the disciples post-resurrection (John 20:22). Furthermore, there is a principle in the Bible where all that the Father has is embodied in the Son and all that the Son has is realized as the Spirit. Therefore, as there is the "grace of Christ" so is there the "Spirit of Christ." Therefore, the Spirit which is the ultimate realization of Christ is grace and is the only way for us to experience grace.

Grace is greater than the law . TODO

## Application

Grace is conditional. If it wasn't conditional, everyone would have it. For example, Noah had to *find* favor in the eyes of God (Gen. 6:8). There are two parties: God in Christ as the Spirit is supplying grace continually, but there must likewise be the receiving of grace continually. The conditionality to receive is to experience the divine romance (Eph. 6:24 ). It is attraction to God which enables us to contact Him and for Him to supply us and meet our need.
