>"I thank my God always concerning you based upon the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus"

\- 1 Cor. 1:4

## Background

Grace is God in His Trinity processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection and ascension to be everything to us. Contrary to the popular notion of grace being mere material gifts from God, grace is God Himself becoming our everything in a subjective way, particularly with an emphasis on enjoyment.

## Biblical Basis

John 1:17 tells us that grace came with Jesus Christ. Before incarnation, grace had not come. 

### Versus Law

Grace is greater than the law .

## Experience 

### Boulder Example

The Lord's grace is our supply. When we encounter a boulder in our path, he may not necessarily remove the boulder. Instead, he may raise the water level so that we may simply float over the boulder.
