>"I thank my God always concerning you based upon the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus"

\- 1 Cor. 1:4

## Background

Grace is God in His Trinity processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection and ascension to be everything to His believers, especially in enjoyment. Contrary to the popular notion of grace being mere material gifts from God, grace is God Himself becoming one's everything in a subjective way.

## Biblical Basis

John 1:17 reveals that grace came with Jesus Christ. Before Christ was processed to be the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) to indwell man (Rom. 8:11), man could not enjoy God as grace. Certain figures in the Old Testament like Noah found favor with God (Gen 6:8) and God showed favor to many others. If grace was simply unmerited favor, then grace would not have come with Jesus Christ.

Furthermore, 1 Corinthians 15:10 says Paul labored more than others, but it was not Him but the grace of God which was with Him. It is not God's unmerited favor which allowed Paul to labor, but the fact that He entered into Paul to be his life and everything.

### Versus Law

Grace is greater than the law .

## Experience 

Grace experienced is God entering into one's situation to be with them and to do in them what they could not do.

### Boulder Example

The Lord's grace is our supply. When we encounter a boulder in our path, he may not necessarily remove the boulder. Instead, he may raise the water level so that we may simply float over the boulder.
