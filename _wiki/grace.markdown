>"I thank my God always concerning you based upon the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus"

\- 1 Cor. 1:4

## Background

**Grace** is the processed and consummated Triune God entering into His regenerated believers as the Spirit to be their everything, especially in the matter of enjoyment. Contrary to the popular, shallow notion of grace being mere unmerited favor or material gifts from God, grace is actually Christ enjoyed by us. When we are open to God's will and cooperate with Him, there is always a sufficient supply of grace to carry out the work. On the contrary, attempting to follow the law out of natural effort actually nullifies grace; thus, self-effort is futile and comes with no supply (Gal. 2:21).

Technically speaking, the entire Bible can be summarized as God in the beginning, the New Jerusalem at the end, and grace in its operation to bring mankind to that ending (Rev. 22:21).

## Etymology

The Greek word for grace (*χάρις*) is related to the verb *χαίρω* which means "to rejoice." Even in traditional usage by the ancient Greeks, grace is not only favor, politeness or aesthetics but also the joy which comes from those things. 

## Not Mere Unmerited Favor

John 1:17 reveals that grace came with Jesus Christ. Before Christ came as the embodiment of all the fulness of the Godhead (Col. 2:9) and was processed to be the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) to indwell man (Rom. 8:11), man could not enjoy God as grace. Certain figures in the Old Testament like Noah found favor with God (Gen 6:8) and God showed favor to many others. If grace was simply unmerited favor, then grace would not have come with Jesus Christ. Furthermore, the verse says the law was *given* while grace *came*. This indicates that grace is a person, whereas the law is an object. The receive the grace is thus to receive Christ as the Spirit, also known as the Spirit of grace (Heb. 10:29).

Furthermore, 1 Corinthians 15:10 says Paul labored more than others, but it was not Him but the grace of God which was with Him. It is not God's unmerited favor which allowed Paul to labor, but the fact that He entered into Paul to be his life and everything. This corresponds to Galatians 2:20 - the not I but Christ here corresponds to not I that labor but grace in 1 Corinthians 15:10 indicating that Christ *is* grace.

Grace is often associated with Christ: grace came through Jesus Christ in John 1:17, and grace is the attribute associated with Christ at the end of many of Paul's epistles (2 Corinthians 13:14; Galatians 6:18). However, grace in its ultimate form is the Spirit. As grace came through Christ so did the Spirit (John 16:13). The all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit was "not yet" prior to Christ's resurrection (John 7:39) and breathed into the disciples post-resurrection (John 20:22). Furthermore, there is a principle in the Bible where all that the Father has is embodied in the Son and all that the Son has is realized as the Spirit. Therefore, as there is the "grace of Christ" so is there the "Spirit of Christ." Therefore, the Spirit which is the ultimate realization of Christ is grace and is the only way for us to experience grace.

> We may be perplexed even frustrated how do we gain this good land? The way to gain this good land is by enjoying grace. Grace is the good land, but I would tell you the way to enjoy the good land is by grace. Yes, we have to apply all diligence we cannot be lazy we have to labor in this good land but I tell you even that labor even that labor needs grace. As we are nearing the end of the year with a new year ahead of us I hope that all of us in the recovery would look forward to a year of more gaining of christ as our good land. More experience of Christ as our good land. But I tell you we pray that way but we have to even pray this: Lord even this desire of mine to gain you I need your grace to work it out. I need your grace to strengthen me to energize me to do that.
