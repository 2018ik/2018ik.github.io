## Background

**Cherishing** is to make someone happy, and goes along with nourishing, the second step of the God-ordained way. Nursing mothers not only feed their children, but also cherish them by playing with them. Once they are cherished and feel happy, then the mothers feed them.

Cherishing is a matter of consistent contact. For dormant ones, new ones, unbelievers, coworkers, classmates, etc., there is no need to even bring up the gospel in the first few visitations. Over time, cherishing opens them up, and when they are open, you can speak a nourishing word to them.
