## Background

The **Firstborn of all creation** according to Colossians 1:15 refers to Christ, and such a title applies to Christ in His humanity, as a creature. According to His divinity, He is the eternal God, the Creator (Isa. 9:6), but according to the flesh and blood of His humanity, He is a creature and the firstborn of all creation.

Although the Lord was incarnated two thousand years ago, He had already came into being since before Abraham. In Genesis 18, Christ appeared to Abraham in His physical body (John 8:56-58), which means Christ had already come into being since prior to His incarnation. But this is still after Adam, and there are even many things which were created before Adam. Genesis 1:1 says God created the heavens and the earth, which evidently also includes angels and other living things on earth, including Satan (Ezek. 28:13-15). 

John 1:1 however plainly states that the Word, referring to Christ, had been such since the beginning. God also made His eternal purpose in Christ Jesus our Lord. Furthermore, Christ had been slain before the foundation of the world (Rev. 13:8). According to the human perspective, Christ was slain two thousand years ago, but according to God's perspective, He was slain before the foundation of the earth. Thus, Christ had mysteriously in God's eternal view become a creature, the Firstborn of all creation.

## Significance

To assert that Jesus was not a creature is to reject His humanity, and to undermine the significance of His incarnation, redemption and resurrection. This was the heresy of the Docetists.
