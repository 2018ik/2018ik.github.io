## Background

**Mary of Bethany** was the sister of Lazarus and Martha.

## History

In Simon the Leper's house, Martha was serving, Lazarus was reclining at the table, and Mary was loving the Lord. She had an alabaster flask filled with a pound of ointment of a very valuable pure nard which she broke and poured on the Lords head, thus filling the house with the fragrance of the ointment (John 12:2-23; Mark 14:3). 

The disciples considered this offering a waste, but this was due to a lack of love.

## Significance

Mary loved the Lord to the uttermost and poured out what she held most precious upon the Lord. The alabaster flask signifies the outer man, which needs to be broken for the inner man to flow forth. God configures environments which tears down the outer man, causing all things to work together for good to those who love Him (Rom. 8:28). Good here does not refer to what is humanly considered good; for example the disciples thought breaking the flask was a bad move. Good refers to gaining more of Christ, to be conformed to His image, to be brought into full sonship (Rom. 8:29).
