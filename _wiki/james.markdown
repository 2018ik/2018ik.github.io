## Background

## Author

James (called *the Just*) was the Lord's brother and was an apostle who played a major role in the church in Jerusalem. God's purpose in inspiring James to write the Epistle of James was actually to expose James. James was zealous for the law, and did not see the New Testament revelation that man might be filled by God to express God. 

Even though James compromised with certain Old Testament practices and emphasized doing good works, He was still not a Judaizer, that is one who continues to believe that Levitical law is binding for all Christians, such as circumcision. When called on by Jewish leaders during the Passover to give a positive testimony for Judaism, James instead testified that "Christ Himself sits in heaven, at the right hand of the Greater Power, nad shall come on th clouds of heaven." Then, he was stoned to death.
