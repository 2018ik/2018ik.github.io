## Background

A **coworker** (equivalent to **fellow worker** or **ambassador**) of God is someone who works as an equal God (1 Cor. 3:9). One must first be reconciled to God in order to work for Him (1 Cor. 5:20).

In order to be coworker of God, we need to know Christ in four points:

1. He is both God and man
2. He posses both divinity and humanity
3. In His humanity he accomplished His judicial redemption through his Death
4. In His divinity He is carrying out His organic salvation in His resurrection

And we aso need to experience and enjoy Christ in His full ministry in His three divine and mystical stages.
