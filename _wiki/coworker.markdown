## Background

A **coworker** or **fellow worker** is someone who works as an equal to another worker.

In order to be coworker of God, we need to know Christ in four points:
1. He is both God and man
2. He posses both divinity and humanity
3. In His humanity he accomplished His judicial redemption through his Death
4. In His divinity He is carrying out His organic salvation in His resurrection

And we aso need to experience and enjoy Christ in His full ministry in His three divine and mystical stages.
