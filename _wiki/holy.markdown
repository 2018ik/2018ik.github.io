## Background

To be **holy** is be sanctified, separated unto God and different, distinct from every that is common. To be holy is not to be perfect or sinless. Only God is different and distinct from all things, thus He alone is holy. In other words, to be holy is to be one with God.

Wherever God is present, that place is holy; all of Genesis the word "holy" is not used, as God had no habitation on earth. Only in Exodus was the tabernacle built with the Holy of Holies, which is where God dwelled. Likewise, God's indwelling of man in the New Testament makes him holy (Rom. 8:9; Eph. 3:17). To be made holy is to be [sanctified](../sanctification).
