## Background

Singing times occur during meetings and conferences, and the purpose is to bring the believers into their spirit and to cultivate an atmosphere of prayer. 

## Leading

### Exercise

If the serving ones leading are not exercising their spirit, then how will the young people? Get together before the meting starts to sing and to have thorough prayer.

### Be Cheerful

The coneferences are a feast, and the singing helps the young people open their mouths and hearts. Those leading must be out of their selves, smiling and leading the young people in their spirit. Practically, this means to make eye contact with the young people, and to move around and to utilize the space, for example hand motions, pointing, etc.

### Post-song Coordination

After each song, there will be a pause of silence. Further instructions i.e. repeating stanzas should be planned before the song ends so as to limit the silences  between songs. Help the young peopel to exercise by declaring and praying the verses before moving to the next song.

### Relax

Those leading the singing are just there as a catalyst to help get things going. Allow the young people to function without being too overbearing.
