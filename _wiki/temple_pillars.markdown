## Background

The two **temple pillars** built by Solomon were composed of bronze, and had nets of checker work, wreaths of chain work, lily work, and pomegranates (1 Kings 7:15-22). The one on right was named Jachin meaning "he will establish," and the one on the left was named Boaz meaning "in Him is strength."
