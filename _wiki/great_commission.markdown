## Background

The **great commission** refers to the charge which Christ gave to His disciples to disciple and teach the nations (Matt. 28:19), and to proclaim the gospel to all creation (Mark. 16:15). This occurred after His resurrection and forty days of preparation and prior to His ascension (Acts 1:2-3).

## Significance

The gospel which the disciples were commissioned with includes not only a repentance of sins, but to witness a resurrected Christ (Acts 2:32; 22:15) to the entire earth (Acts 1:8). To witness a resurrected Christ requires us to be in resurrection. Likewise, as a commission given post-resurrection, it can be said that such a commission is only possible with resurrection.
