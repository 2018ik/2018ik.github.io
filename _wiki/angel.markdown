## Background

Angels (Greek: angelos) refer to celestial beings sent by God as messengers, but also in rare cases refer to human messengers (Luke 7:24; Rev. 2:1).

## Purpose

Unlike man, the Triune God does not dwell in the angels and therefore the angels cannot dispense the life of God into others. This makes them incapable of preaching of gospel, which is why the angel of God sent to Cornelius told him to find Peter, rather than gospelizing him directly (Acts 10:1-8).
