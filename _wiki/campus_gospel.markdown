## Background

The **campus gospel** is important as college campuses are one of the only places on earth with a large, diverse population who are at a turning point in their lives. The best window of opportunity to preach the gospel to college students is during the orientation phase in the beginning of a semester, as well as to freshman in particular. It is easy for a person to receive the gospel when they are undergoing change. 

## Grasping the Opportunity

The campus labor can be compared to harvest wheat in northern China. In may, when the wheat is ripe, none of the farmers are concerned about eating or sleeping. The saying goes: "The wheat is falling; why are you sleeping?" Once the wheat is ripe, it must be harvest immediately.

Likewise, the new students coming into schools must be "harvested" immediately. The campus work must not be bothered with anything else, not the Lord's Day meeting or any other matters, other than the new students. 

## Freshman

Not only are freshman (first-years) the most open, they also have the most time left in the university. This gives them more time to see the full vision of the economy of God. Compare this to a master's student or junior who only has half the amount of time left. 

## How to Preach

### Choosing

Do not go by how someone looks on how open they are - you will be absolutely wrong. Notice the details; see if anyone is wearing/doing anything which you can personally relate to. Likewise, based on how they respond, you can discern where they are in their experience of Christ e.g. are they even saved.

### Testimony

Those who we preach to should be a testimony to all the nations (Matt 24:14). The demographic of the campus club should be similar to the demographic of the campus itself.

### Oneness

The campus work should be one. There should not be separate operations carried out by disparate groups of local saints, full-time serving ones, trainees, college students, etc. 

### Questions to Expect

1. What makes you different from the other Christian clubs?
2. Is this part of a church?
3. What do you do? Why should I join this club?

### Cold Gospel

Cold gospel preaching is shorter in duration compared to the vital gospel, and should reach more people.

1. Don't ask if it's OK/good to talk. Just start talking.
2. Know how to ask for their phone number
3. Follow up

### Follow up

1. Don't text at the wrong time. 6 AM for example is one of the worst times for getting a response. 4 - 5:30 PM or past 9 PM appears to maximize response rate.
2. Text like a freshman; come down to their level
3. First text to send can be something like "Hey is this <name>?"
4. Match their texting cadence
