## Background

The best window of opportunity to preach the gospel to college students is during the orientation phase in the beginning of a semester, as well as to freshman in particular. It is easy for a person to receive the gospel when they are undergoing change. 

## Grasping the Opportunity

The campus labor can be compared to harvest wheat in northern China. In may, when the wheat is ripe, none of the farmers are concerned about eating or sleeping. The saying goes: "The wheat is falling; why are you sleeping?" Once the wheat is ripe, it must be harvest immediately.

Likewise, the new students coming into schools must be "harvested" immediately. The campus work must not be bothered with anything else, not the Lord's Day meeting or any other matters, other than the new students. 

## Freshman

Not only are freshman (first-years) the most open, they also have the most time left in the university. This gives them more time to see the full vision of the economy of God. Compare this to a master's student or junior who only has half the amount of time left.

## How to Preach

### Choosing

Remember your target: find the freshman, don't talk to older people (we care about them, but focus on the campus work).

Do not go by how someone looks on how open they are - you will be absolutely wrong. Notice the details; see if anyone is wearing/doing anything which you can personally relate to. Likewise, based on how they respond, you can discern where they are in their experience of Christ e.g. are they even saved.

### Testimony

Those who we preach to should be a testimony to all the nations (Matt 24:14). The demographic of the campus club should be similar to the demographic of the campus itself.

### Questions to Expect

1. What makes you different from the other Christian clubs?
2. Is this part of a church?
3. What do you do? Why should I join this club?

### Cold Gospel

Cold gospel preaching is shorter in duration compared to the vital gospel, and should reach more people.

1. Don't ask if it's OK/good to talk. Just start talking.
2. Know how to ask for their phone number
3. Follow up

### Follow up

1. Don't text at the wrong time. 6 AM for example is one of the worst times for getting a response. 4 - 5:30 PM or past 9 PM appears to maximize response rate.
2. Text like a freshman; come down to their level
3. First text to send should be "Hey is this <name>?"
4. Match their texting cadence

### 6+1 Items You Need

1. Spirit
2. Body
3. Prayer
4. Word
5. Homes
6. Proper daily living
7. Universal love

## Commission

September is a golden time to catch the freshmen. Every September we should be able to catch a good number. This does not mean that we do not preach the gospel to others. Our daily walk, our meetings, and our communal life are all a type of gospel preaching. Wherever we live, we influence the community. But we must purposely form teams to go to the campuses to reach the young people. If we do this with much prayer, a good number will be brought in. Let September be the time to make contact and October the month to reap. During these months, concentrate your time and labor on reaping a new crop of freshmen. First you reap them, then you build them up. After that, you may use them to gain their classmates or roommates. We need to do the same thing year after year. I believe that each time we do this, more freshmen will be reaped. Do not miss this opportunity.
