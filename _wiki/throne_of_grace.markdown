## Background

The **throne of God** is His throne which is in heaven, and signifies His authority toward the entire universe.

## Aspects

### Throne of Grace

The throne of grace emphasizes His grace toward the believers (Heb. 4:16). This is the reality of the expiation cover (or mercy seat) within the Holy of Holies (Exo. 25:17). Through the [process which Christ went through](.,./processed_triune_god), regenerated believers can enter into the reality of the Holy of Holies (the human spirit) in order to touch the throne of grace (Heb. 10:19-22).
