## Background

**Haggai** reveals the building of the house of Jehovah is related to the welfare of God's people today and the consummation of the millennial kingdom.
A remnant of Israel returned from Babylon to the holy land but they were busy dwelling in their paneled-up houses while God's house was lying waste (Hag. 1:4). This is the situation of some of the saints in the Lord's recovery. They might have left Babylon, degraded Christianity and cam back to Jerusalem, God's chosen ground, the ground of locality. But they are so busy with their own work and their own literal house rather than God's house.
