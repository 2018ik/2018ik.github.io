## Background

**Song of Songs** is a poem of the progressive experience of an individual believer's loving fellowship with Christ, illustrated by the history of love in an excellent marriage. The poem's depiction of a relationship between King Solomon and the Shulammite, a country girl (S.S. 6:13), is a parallel to the relationship of God to His believers in the New Testament. The Lord wants a bride that matches Him in maturity, and the preparation of this bride is seen in six major stages. 

## Summary

### Stage One

In the first stage, the lover of Christ is drawn to pursue Him for satisfaction (S.S. 1:2-2:7). This required a hunger and a thirst - the lover knew that Christ's life was better than wine (S.S. 1:2) and that His anointing oils had a pleasant fragrance (S.S. 1:3). Although she was drawn by the Lord, she was also like a mare among Pharaoh's chariots (S.S. 1:9), indicating she was strong in her natural self and required further transformation to match God. 

Yet, despite such issues, she is nevertheless referred to as "my love" and described in a very positive way (S.S. 1:9-11). Furthermore, she is given rest and enjoyment by being brought to the banqueting house and sustained with raisin cakes and apples (S.S. 2:4-5).

### Stage Two

In the second stage, the lover of Christ is called to be delivered from the self through her oneness with the cross of Christ. The Lord is one who leaps upon mountains and skips upon hills (S.S. 2:8), signifying Christ's power to overcome difficulties i.e. resurrection power. 

### Stage Three

In the third stage, the lover of Christ is called to live in ascension as the new creation in resurrection. While in stage one, she was described as a mare of Pharaoh's chariots, in this stage, she is now a palanquin for the king Himself (S.S. 3:9). 

### Stage Four

In 6:13 she is called "Shulammite" the feminine form of Solomon, signifying the exact duplication of Christ Himself, having been made a match for Him. Interestingly, this name of the female lead is not mentioned until chapter 6. This is because sufficient transformation was required for the lover to match Solomon, and for today's believers to match Christ.

### Stage Five

In the fifth stage, the lover of Christ shares in the work of the Lord.

### Stage Six

In the sixth stage, the lover of Christ is waiting to be raptured. 

## Topics

### Love

If you want to love the Lord, you should read and pray read over Song of Songs.

### Second Coming

Song of Songs closes with the lover of Christ praying that her Beloved would make haste (S.S. 8:14). This parallels the conclusion of the book of Revelation, where the Spirit and the bride say "come" (Rev. 22:7) and John declares "Come, Lord Jesus!" (Rev. 22:20). When the shulamite is fully transformed throughout the progression throughout the book, she begins to love the Lord's appearing.
