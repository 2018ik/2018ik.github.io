### Love

If you want to love the Lord, you should read and pray read over Song of Songs.

### Second Coming

Song of Songs closes with the lover of Christ praying that her Beloved would make haste (S.S. 8:14). This parallels the conclusion of the book of Revelation, where the Spirit and the bride say "come" (Rev. 22:7) and John declares "Come, Lord Jesus!" (Rev. 22:20). When the shulamite is fully transformed throughout the progression throughout the book, she begins to love the Lord's appearing.
