## Background

The **world** (Greek: kosmos) in the negative sense refers to the **world system**, which is the system created by Satan that includes all people, matters and things outside of God to distract man from God (1 John 5:19). Even things necessary for human existence such as food, protection, and pleasure are systematized by Satan to usurp God. For example, it is one thing to eat a tasty meal for sustenance, but it is another to splurge on a 7-course Michelin-starred meal while simultaneously vlogging, blogging, and reviewing the occasion to upload to every social media and streaming platform to build up your online presence as an esteemed "foodie." Eating is not the world, but this food-system of the modern era has evidently been systematized by Satan to become the world.

Behind all tangible things is the intangible enemy who operates behind the scenes (Eph. 6:12). We must be clear regarding the world and sanctify ourselves from it as in Galatians 6:14 and 1 John 5:19. According to these two verses, the whole world lies in the evil one, but this world has been crucified to Paul and Paul to the world.

The "world" can also refer to the physical world (Col 1:6) or the people within the world (John 3:16). It is also used in 1 Peter 3:3 to refer to outward adornments and fancy garments which is the satanic systematization of the necessity of clothing oneself to become self-beautification.

## History

Originally, God was everything to man and was his pleasure and protection. Man at this point had neither fallen into sin nor the world. Upon eating of the tree, man first fell into sin and was no longer in God's presence. Now, man needed a replacement for God, that is the world. Cain invented agriculture, amusement and other elements of human civilization to sustain himself and his family. These are things necessary for human existence, however the need or perhaps more accurately "want" that humans sense for these things is greater than God. 

## Significance

The world is anything in excess that is beyond our need. Christians often focus on sinfulness, but the world's usurpation is much more subtle. A person who has fallen into sin is easily seen as problematic, and may even be repentant. A person who is occupied by good but worldly things is seen as fine, even wonderful. Yet, they are fully consumed by something other than God
