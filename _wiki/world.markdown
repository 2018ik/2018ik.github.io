## Background

The **world** (Greek: kosmos) can refer to the physical world, but more significantly it refers to the **world system**, which is the system created by Satan that includes all people, matters and things outside of God to distract man from God (1 John 5:19). Behind all tangible things is the intangible enemy who operates behind the scenes (Eph. 6:12). , as in Galatians 6:14 and 1 John 5:19. According to these two verses, the whole world lies in the evil one, but this world has been crucified to Paul and Paul to the world.
