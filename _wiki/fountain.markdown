## Background

**Fountains** throughout the Bible signify God as the source from which living waters are dispensed into His people for their enjoyment. To enjoy God as the fountain, believers must drink of Him and flow Him out day by day. To forsake God as the fountain is to hew out for oneself broken cisterns (Jer. 2:13), which is any source other than God. These cisternal replacements can even be good things: Bible study, doing good, etc.

## Biblical Basis

Jeremiah 2:13 says that God is the fountain of living waters.
