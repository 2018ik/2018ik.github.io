## Background

**Fountains** throughout the Bible signify God, particularly the Father, as the source from which living waters are dispensed into His people for their enjoyment, constituting them with the element of God. To apply God as the fountain, believers must drink of Him and flow Him out day by day. 

After the fall of man, they no longer depended on God as the source, thus forsaking God. To forsake God as the fountain is to hew out for oneself broken cisterns (Jer. 2:13), which is any source other than God. These cisternal replacements can even be good things: a successful career, doctrinal knowledge, doing good, etc.

## Biblical Basis

Jeremiah 2:13 says that God is the fountain of living waters.
