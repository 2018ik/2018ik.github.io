## Background

**Dispensations** (or simply, **ages**) are periods of time throughout the Bible where God deals with man in a particular way. These can be divided into many ways, such as the seven dispensations of innocence, conscience, human government, promise, law, grace and the kingdom. Most generally however, there are four notable dispensations prior to eternity future: the dispensations of sin, law, grace and the kingdom.

## Sin

Sin entered in through Adam.

## Law

The dispensation of law spanned from Moses receiving the law to the first coming of Christ. God's dealing with man in the Old Testament was based on the law.

## Grace

The dispensation of grace spans from the first coming of Christ to the second coming of Christ.

## Kingdom

The dispensation of the kingdom begins with the second coming of Christ and ends after 1000 years.
