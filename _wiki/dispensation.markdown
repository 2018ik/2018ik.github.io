## Background

**Dispensations** (or simply, **ages**) are periods of time throughout the Bible where God deals with man in a particular way. The Bible is traditionally divided into the seven dispensations of innocence, conscience, human government, promise, law, grace and the kingdom. Most generally however, there are only four overarching dispensations: the dispensations of sin, law, grace and the kingdom. 

## Etymology

The word "dispensation" comes from the Latin word *dispensatio* is equivalent to the Greek *oikonomia* often translated as economy, administration or stewardship. The word dispensation implies a distribution or dispensing of privileges, duties or responsibilities to a those under its government. God's government with man at different times is for a particular purpose, thus, the Bible can be divided into various dispensations.

## Sin

Sin entered in through Adam.

## Law

The dispensation of law spanned from Moses receiving the law to the first coming of Christ. God's dealing with man in the Old Testament was based on the law.

## Grace

The dispensation of grace spans from the first coming of Christ to the second coming of Christ.

## Kingdom

The dispensation of the kingdom begins with the second coming of Christ and ends after 1000 years.
