## Background

The **mind** is the part of the soul that can know, consider, and remember. It oftentimes is the leading part of the soul. The mind enables a person to understand what is going on in the body and spirit; importantly, it understands the intuition's sense.

## Significance

The mind set of the spirit is critical for spiritual experience (Rom. 8:6). Eventually, the mingled spirit spreads into and saturates the mind, where the mind possesses the spirit and the spirit possesses the mind, issuing in the spirit of the mind (Eph. 4:23). The mind of Christ Jesus can actually become one with His believers (Phil. 2:5). This is a process of renewing, which results in transformation of one's entire being (Rom. 12:2).

## Biblical Basis

### The Soul

Proverbs 2:10 says that knowledge will be pleasant to the soul, and Psalm 139:14 says that the soul knows. Psalm 13:2 shows that one can take counsel in their soul. Analyzing or considering the best decision is a function of the mind. Lamentations 3:20 shows that the soul can remember things, and remembrance is also a function of the mind.
