## Background

The mind is the part of the soul that can know, consider, and remember. It oftentimes is the leading part of the soul.

## Significance

The mind understands the intuition's sense. The mind set of the spirit is critical for spiritual experience (Rom. 8:6). Eventually, the mingled spirit spreads into the mind, where the mind possesses the spirit and the spirit posseses the mind, issuing in the spirit of the mind (Eph. 4:23).

## Biblical Basis

### The Soul

Proverbs 2:10 says that knowledge will be pleasant to the soul, and Psalm 139:14 says that the soul knows. Psalm 13:2 shows that one can take counsel in their soul. Analyzing or considering the best decision is a function of the mind. Lamentations 3:20 shows that the soul can remember things, and remembrance is also a function of the mind.
