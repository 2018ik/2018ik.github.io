## Background

**Exercising the spirit** is to use the spirit. When one has an exercised spirit, death and sin is washed away. The secret to the exercise of the spirit is actually an exercised will. Much like exercising the physical body, exercising the spirit requires the will to choose.

## Unto Godliness

1 Timothy 4:7 says to exercise yourself unto godliness. To exercise unto godliness requires the exercise of the spirit, but it requires more than the spirit; the verse says *yourself*, which is more general than the spirit. Godliness is an expression; it is Christ lived out of the divine reality within.
