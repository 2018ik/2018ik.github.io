## Background

**Exercising the spirit** is to use the spirit, which means to willfully turn one's heart toward and set one's mind on the spirit (2 Cor. 3:16; Rom. 8:6). Not exercising the spirit means living in the soul or the flesh, and is the "default" state of man, even regenerated believers. Exercise of the spirit does not imply any particular outward activity such as praying or singing, but it is to be constantly in contact with God in one's daily walk (Rom. 8:4). When one has an exercised spirit, death and sin is washed away. The secret to the exercise of the spirit is actually an exercised will. Much like exercising the physical body, exercising the spirit requires the will to choose.

## Unto Godliness

1 Timothy 4:7 says to exercise yourself unto godliness. To exercise unto godliness requires the exercise of the spirit, but it requires more than the spirit; the verse says *yourself*, which is more general than the spirit. Godliness is an expression; it is Christ lived out of the divine reality within.
