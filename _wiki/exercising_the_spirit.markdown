## Background

**Exercising the spirit** is to use the spirit, which means to willfully turn one's heart toward and set one's mind on the spirit (2 Cor. 3:16; Rom. 8:6). This is similar to bodily exercise where one must force their physical body to accomplish a certain task (1 Tim. 4:8). Likewise, Christians must force themselves to use their spirit. Not exercising the spirit means living in the soul or the flesh, and is the "default" state of man, even regenerated believers. When one has an exercised spirit, death and sin is washed away. The secret to the exercise of the spirit is actually an exercised will. Much like exercising the physical body, exercising the spirit requires the will to choose.

## Biblical Basis
 
Exercise of the spirit does not imply any particular outward activity such as praying or singing, but it is to be constantly in contact with God in one's daily walk (Rom. 8:4). 1 Timothy 4:7 says to exercise yourself unto godliness. To exercise unto godliness requires the exercise of the spirit, as only that which is spiritual can be godly. But the expression of godliness is the issue, the verse says to exercise *yourself*, which points to the exercise of one's person. This begins by turning our heart to the Lord to fan our spirit into flame (1 Tim. 1:6; 2 Cor. 3:16). Then, we need to remain exercised by setting our mind on the spirit (Rom. 8:6). As a result, we are able to discern the spirit and the soul in order to live out Christ (Heb. 4:12).
