## Background

**Son of man** implies God in His humanity. He was born as a man in the lowest status, and raised up in the despised city of Nazareth. He was without an outward beauty of attraction (Isa. 53:2-3). Despite this, he was able to contact every kind of man, and cherish, comfort and heal them - even the most sinful tax collector. 

## Cherishing

The Lord attracted and cherished people in His humanity, that is to make them happy, comfort them and give them rest. If he came in His divine status, he would intimidate us. His visiting was His cherishing; His death on the cross was the biggest cherishing to redeem us.

## Nourishing

In resurrection the Son of Man was transfigured to become the life-giving Spirit. This Spirit is for nourishing. 

## Designated

Before the incarnation of Jesus, Christ was already the Son of God (Rom 8:3). However, through incarnation, He put on the human element, which needed to be sanctified and uplifted by passing through death and resurrection. In Matthew 26:64, the Lord prophesies that they will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on clouds of heaven. This is the designation and elevation of Christ's humanity at His resurrection.

In Romans 1:4, we see that He was *designated* the *firstborn* Son of God (in contrast with *only*-begotten Son of God in John 3:16). Designation implies there was something not "Son of God"-like before, and that would be the humanity of Jesus. Now as the Son of God, he possesses both divinity and humanity. 

As this designated One is the firstborn, and not the only-begotten, there will be more sons in the future. Christ the firstborn son serves as a prototype to produce His many sons. We too can be designated and revealed as sons of God, possessing both divinity and humanity.
