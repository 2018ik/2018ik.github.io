## Background

**Dealing with the conscience** is a crucial part of the Christian life because the conscience is the leading part of the spirit upon which the exercise of the spirit hinges. This involves opening to God to receive light in order to confess and be cleaned, as in the cycle of life in 1 John. If the conscience is not properly dealt with, one can become shipwrecked regarding the faith (1 Tim. 1:19). Dealing with the conscience should not be a menial task which one does to no end, but the goal in view should be to gain the Lord's presence.

## How To

To deal with the conscience is to take heed of your conscience by saying "amen" to the speaking of the conscience and caring for the feeling of the conscience. The conscience is a reactive organ, not a proactive organ. To proactively try to "exercise" the conscience is to be in introspection.
