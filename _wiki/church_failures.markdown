## Background

There are many **failures** of the early church recorded in the New Testament such as hypocrisy and bringing back the law/Jewish practices. Eventually, these failures would result in the degradation of the church, not only in singular events of failure but the cutting off of the life, living and growth of the church. Such degradation can be seen in the six of the seven churches in Revelation chapters 2 and 3.

## Significance

## Hypocrisy

The record of Ananias and Sapphira in Acts 5:1-11 is an illustration of hypocrisy, which is to make oneself appear to be what they are not. The couple wanted to make it look like they donated their entire house, when they had secretly set aside a portion of the proceeds. 

## Racial Differences

In the matter of eating - Acts 6:1

## The Law

1. Circumcision (Phil. 3:2; Gal. 5:2)
2. Annulling the freedom in Christ (Gal. 2:3-4)
3. Peter shrank back from the gentiles when James and the Jewish believers arrived (Gal. 2:12-13)
4. Eating and observing of days (Rom. 14:2-5)

## Judaism

Acts 21:20-26

Resulted in the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus in A.D. 70

## Different Teachings

Teaching contrary to the Apostle's teaching (Rom. 16:17;  1 Tim. 6:3)

## Being Puffed Up

Ranking gifted people against each other to see who has the greatest gift is unto strife and divisions (1 Cor. 1:11-12).

## Fornication

1 Cor 5:1; 6

## Lawsuits

1 Cor. 6:6

Personal lawsuits stem from ones keeping their own rights and an unwillingness to be wronged. A person fights for their rights because they care about their self, but the Lord tells us to deny the self.

## Questionings

Paul's apostleship (1 Cor. 9:1-3; 2 Cor. 12:16)

## Bad Eating

1. Partaking of the table of the Lord and the table of demons (1 Cor. 10:21)
2. Eating the bread and drinking the cup oft he Lord in an unworthy manner (1 Cor. 11:27, 29)

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

> If you just had chidlren and were raising your kids, and there was a ministry centered around raising and caring for children, you would like that. since your heart is on your children. Yo uwant your children to be somebody in the future. Here's a ministry that cares for the children, of course I will go there. I will go to their seminars! This will cause a fall away from God's economy. That's a big difference.

> In 1995 or 96 there were some saints from Taiwan they talk about being spiritual to the homes. Being spiritual not just in the meetings but it must be in the homes. That sounds good right? But when Brother lee heard that, he said no don't say that don't share that. I was sitting down there I was one of the coworkers so I heard and I thought "why o you do that? It sounds good we should be spiritual athomes not just at the meeting." Borther Lee said no, because this is contrary to God's economy. God wants you, not just you be a good parent, God wants you to live God to be a God man. This is God's economy. God wants to come into you and live out from you.

> But we could make something that looks like God but we can make it some teaching, such as the teaching of the Nicolaitans, it is a good teaching: "You are too busy, in the world making money, so leave the things of God to some class of people." The Nicolaitans are the holy people who went to seminary and were ordained they could do a lot of things. When I was preaching the gospel I met some people who told me, what are you doing? You can't pray until you are a pastor, so you must be pastor. so they called me a pastor. I said "no everyone should pray, everyone should have a direct relationship with the Lord right" To the taeching of the nicolaitans you cannot pray, you can only come to an intermediary to pray for you. You do not pray yourself, you have to ask for a pastor to pray for you.
