## Background

To be **trained** is to have the knowledge and growth of life, the building up of one's character, and to learn how to serve and coordinate in the church life. 

## Biblical Basis

From the very beginning God had the intention to train and discipline His people. Why did God need to train His people in the Old Testament? It was to learn to dwell with God, with whom there was a massive disparity in knowing. The training was for them to match God. He wanted to form them into an army. Today, God wants to dwell in our midsts, but there is a massive disparity. We need to learn how to live with Him, how to match Him.

Jacob received a great deal of personal training, consummating in his renaming to Israel. Then, the children of Israel also received much training as they were brought out of Egypt. In addition to building the tabernacle, there was also a priestly service to serve in the tabernacle. All this took a great deal of training.

In Deuteronomy, there was a renewed training to the new generation of Israelites after their long wandering to prepare them to enter into the good land promised by God. 

In Song of Songs, the lover of Christ progresses through six stages in her transformation. Particularly, she is described as having eyes like pools (S.S. 7:4). This is a certain view of God's move on earth. Also at the end the seeker tells the Lord to rise up and go to the vineyards and fields. This shows that the seeker's heart has been enlarged for God's move on the whole earth. To be trained is for people to gain the Lord's burden not only for a single city or country, but the whole earth.
