## Background

To be **trained** is to have the knowledge and growth of life, the building up of one's character, and to learn how to serve and coordinate in the church life.

Of course we are here to grow in the Lord, but what does that mean in our preparation to serve the Lord? I think it is very common among us as persons or young adults in our shoes that we have some definition of who we are. 

If this was a class of college freshman, some feel like "I'm really good at this, I'm going to major in this" and some think "I'm really not this kind of person." You can be a STEM person, or a humanities person. We kind of start to define ourselves as we go on in life. That's healthy in a way, but also limiting. The truth is, we don't know ourselves. We don't know what the Lord wants to make us, or what the Lord wants to be to us. If we say "I am not" we should push again, this limits what the Lord can do. 

With this kind of context, I hope no one here can say I'm just not somebody who can be constituted with the truth. You may say that I'm just one of these persons who is deep in the Lord, I'm a very experiential person, maybe I'm not very clear about the truth but I know God very well. Or maybe you say the other way around - I'm a truth oriented person, and I don't really like people. But we simply don't know what the Lord has in store for us. We have to depend on the Lord. 

Matthew 25 has the parable of the handing out talents to His slaves. You can have 1, 2, or 5 talents. We have a thought that we were born who we are, since the DNA is all there and whatnot. Matthew 25:15 says that talent is given according to our ability. This is our natural ability, which is constituted of God's creation and our learning. Whatever the Lord has given us is based on our ability, so it's not necessarily static. 

The FTTA is a place to learn, and if we're committed to learning, we will inevitably make some mistakes. I still remember pre-training decades ago one of the training brothers asked, "Is it better to be dead right or livingly wrong?" And he stood up and said, "Dead right!!!" Ironically, this was a display of being livingly wrong. We need a learning spirit. Do not say that we are this or that kind of person.

Why did God need to train His people in the Old Testament? It was to learn to dwell with God, with whom there was a massive disparity in knowing. The training was for them to match God. He wanted to form them into an army. Today, God wants to dwell in our midsts, but there is a massive disparity. We need to learn how to live with Him, how to match Him.

## Old Testament

According to the Old Testament, from the very beginning God had the intention to train and discipline His people. Jacob received a great deal of personal training, consummating in his renaming to Israel. Then, the children of Israel also received much training as they were br ought out of Egypt. In addition to building the tabernacle, there was also a priestly service to serve in the tabernacle. All this took a great deal of training.

In Deuteronomy, there was a renewed training to the new generation of Israelites after their long wandering to prepare them to enter into the good land promised by God. 

In Song of Songs, the lover of Christ progresses through six stages in her transformation. Particularly, she is described as having eyes like pools (S.S. 7:4). This is a certain view of God's move on earth. Also at the end the seeker tells the Lord to rise up and go to the vineyards and fields. This shows that the seeker's heart has been enlarged for God's move on the whole earth. To be trained is for people to gain the Lord's burden not only for a single city or country, but the whole earth.
