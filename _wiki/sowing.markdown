## Background

**Sowing** is a putting forth of something which will eventually grow and be reaped. The Christian life is one of sowing either unto the flesh or unto the Spirit (Gal. 6:8). A saved person who was first born according to the flesh and now born according to the Spirit (Gal. 4:29; John 3:6) can now live and walk according to either the flesh or the Spirit (Gal. 5:25; Rom. 8:4) and sow unto the flesh or unto the Spirit (Gal. 6:8).

Sowing here is equivalent to one's living: to live unto the flesh is to sow corruption, while to live unto the Spirit is to sow eternal life. The implication of sowing though is that there are consequences. The word *unto* means "with a view to" or "resulting in" indicating that one's sowing can result in either the corruption of the flesh or the eternal life of the Spirit. In our schooling, working, grocery shopping, the way we dress, etc., is the goal the flesh or the Spirit? Everything we do or say is an act of sowing; when we are not walking according to our mingled spirit, we are inevitably sowing unto the flesh seeds of corruption. We must not be deceived in this matter (Gal. 6:7).

## Significance

Sowing unto the flesh has the particular emphasis of reaping what one has sown in the future. If a person murmurs, gossips, and spreads rumors in the church, they will reap a harvest of corruption. Likewise, if a person prays, speaking building up, and fellowships, they will reap a harvest of life eternal. This reaping manifests not only in themselves, but also the entire household of faith which includes all the believers on earth.
