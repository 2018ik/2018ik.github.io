## Background

**Sowing** is a putting forth of something which will eventually grow and be reaped. The Christian life is one of sowing either unto the flesh or unto the Spirit (Gal. 6:8). Sowing here is equivalent to one's living: to live unto the flesh is to sow corruption, while to live unto the Spirit is to sow eternal life. The word *unto* means "with a view to," indicating that the goal of one's sowing is either the flesh or the Spirit. In our schooling, working, grocery shopping, the way we dress, etc., is the goal the flesh or the Spirit? Everything we do or say is an act of sowing; when we are not walking according to our mingled spirit, we are inevitably sowing unto the flesh seeds of corruption. 

## Significance

Sowing unto the flesh has the particular emphasis of reaping what one has sown in the future. If a person murmurs, gossips, and spreads rumors in the church, they will reap a harvest of corruption. Likewise, if a person prays, speaking building up, and fellowships, they will reap a harvest of life eternal. This reaping manifests not only in themselves, but also the entire household of faith which includes all the believers on earth. 

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1
