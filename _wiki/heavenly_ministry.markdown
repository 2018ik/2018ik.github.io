## Background

Christ's **heavenly ministry** refers to the work He is accomplishing beginning after His [ascension](../christ_ascension) as the life-giving Spirit. In the New Testament, this includes His ascension, pouring out of the economical Spirit, sending out of the disciples, and raising up of gifted ones to perfect the saints for the Lord's return. This is not just an idle downtime prior to the second coming, but He is in fact more active now than even during His earthly ministry. It can be said that as far as the accomplishment of redemption is concerned, Christ is sitting at the right hand is concerned, as it is finished (John 19:30). But with regards to His heavenly ministry, He is standing in order to carry out His New Testament economy (Acts 7:55).The goal of the heavenly ministry is to gain a full salvation in the believers, that they can build up the Body of Christ.

In His heavenly ministry, Christ is interceding and praying for His people.


## Stages

### Ascension

Christ ascended and was made Lord, Christ (Acts 2:36), Ruler of the kings of the earth (Rev. 1:5), and established by God to be Minister of His new covenant (Heb 8:2). This qualifies Him to arrange every situation for man that they may be saved to the uttermost.

### Pouring Out

The pouring out of the economical Spirit in Acts was for the formation of the universal church, and to empower the disciples to carry out His move to build the church, the Body of Christ.

### Sending Out

The sending out allows the gospel to be preached and for local churches to be established.

### Gifted Ones

The gifted ones perfect the saints unto the work of the ministry unto the building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:11-12).

### Second Coming

The overcomers of this age will consummate the age and bring in the second coming of Christ.
