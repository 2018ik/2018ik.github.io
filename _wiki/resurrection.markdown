## Background

**Resurrection** is to bring the dead back to life, and only be accomplished through Christ, who is resurrection itself (John 11:25). There are many instances of resurrection throughout the Bible, however true resurrection was only possible after [that of Jesus Himself](../christ_resurrection).
