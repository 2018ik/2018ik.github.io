## Background

**Resurrection** is to change death into life, and can only be accomplished through Christ, who is resurrection itself (John 11:25). The principle of resurrection is that the natural life is killed for the divine life to rise up in its place (2 Cor. 1:9). Resurrection is the life pulse and the lifeline of God's divine economy. The experience of resurrection life today is through Christ as the [all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit](../spirit#compound_spirit).

There are many instances of resurrection as a physical raising of the dead throughout the Bible, however the reality of resurrection began with [the Lord Jesus](../christ_resurrection). 

Resurrection is altogether victorious over death; resurrection life overcomes death without being damaged or injured by death (John 11:25; Rev. 1:17-18; 2:8). Death is powerless to do anything with resurrection (Acts 2:24). When the enemy makes a believer think that they are finished, they must remember that within their regenerated spirit is resurrection, and that resurrection will surely defeat the enemy. This is the life which conquers all suffering, and the experience of this life is actually why believers suffer in the first place.

## Experience

In experience, believers first receive the power of Christ's resurrection through their salvation, and then by this power, they can live a crucified life by taking the death of Christ as the mold of their living. Thus, the order in this kind of experience is resurrection then death.

### Process

Resurrection is a present process; to walk in resurrection today is to reign in life (Rom. 6:5). 

In resurrection we all will be like angels, no distinction between males and females. To be brought into the reality of the body of Christ, our whole being must be in resurrection. 

### Destiny

Resurrection is our destiny; there is a time coming where every particle of our body is in resurrection as the bride of Christ.

The mingling of divinity and humanity was not complete on incarnation; the human flesh of Jesus had nothing to do with divinity. It was in resurrection that humanity was brought into divinity. It is only in death that was can experience resurrection; resurrection is entering into death, passing through death, and emerging from death.

The principle of resurrection is that everything natural must pass through death and then resurrect with God's element. 

In the New Jerusalem, the Lamb on the throne represents the resurrected firstborn Son of God who has now been glorified and enthroned. The regenerated believers as the bride of Christ are the constituents of the New Jerusalem. The life-giving Spirit is the river of water of life. No resurrection, no Body of Christ, no New Jerusalem, no fulfillment of God's economy.

## God of Resurrection

The principle of resurrection is that our end is the Lord's beginning. The Lord will "checkmate" us and put us into situations where we have no hope in ourselves, so that will fully turn to God. 

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>In Manila, there are textile factories where fabrics are plunged into a bath of dye, thereby losing their original beauty, their former color. It is in a sense what we may call a devastating experience for those fabrics. But after being permeated with dye, eventually, they took on beautiful colors. We may say it was brought out of the vat of dye with splendid hues. This is an example of what it means to enjoy the God of resurrection. On one hand, we enjoy the living God who performs miracles in our lives. For example, a brother may suffer an illness, and the Lord may heal him from that illness as he prays for the true and living God to deliver him from this illness. That is to know God as the living God. But there is a greater lesson for us to learn, and that is to know the Lord as the God of resurrection.
>
>The same brother who suffered from the illness was now suffering from an even more severe illness, say terminal cancer. Then he must know the Lord as not only the living God, but the God of resurrection. As he loses all of his hope in himself and medical science - although he may be treated in a hospital by skillful doctors - his trust is no longer based on physical things but on God who raised the dead. He would pray these words recorded in 2 Corinthians 1: "Oh God, deliver me from so great a death. Through this experience, work yourself into me, constitute your very being into the fiber of my being. I'd like to know you as the God of resurrection. Use this opportunity to impart gold, silver, and precious stones into me so that as I am healed, I'll be constituted with the God of resurrection."
>
>Well, brothers and sisters, this is what the apostles experienced in 2 Corinthians chapter 1. Paul and his apostles were excessively burdened beyond their power to cope with their sufferings. These types of circumstances cause our dear brothers to base their confidence not on themselves but on the God who raised them from the dead.

### Testimony #2

>In 1942, Watchman Nee was excommunicated from the church in Shanghai, and he told others that he felt that his ministry would never resume again. But through the resurrection power he was brought back, and hundreds of churches were revived and raised up.
>
>In the late 1950s and early 1960s there were ambitious coworkers who raised up dissension and rebellion among the churches in Taiwan. Brother Lee was led by the Lord to migrate to the U.S. to carry out the Lord's work, and the coworkers in Taiwan implored Lee to come back to deal with the rebellion. However Brother Lee said not to worry, as if the work he carried out is of men, it should be destroyed and must be destroyed. But if this work is of God, no one can destroy it. Eventually, the churches in Taiwan were brought into resurrection. Death cannot hold the resurrection life. If we hear of certain churches that are passing through a turmoil, we need to pray to bring those churches into resurrection. Bring them into the third day. 
>
>In Christ's resurrection, He became a life-giving Spirit, which is the highest significance of resurrection. Did you realize that becoming a life-giving Spirit is also a work of Christ? We will realize one day that it is a work to become a husband, it is a marvelous work to become a Father, likewise to become a life-giving Spirit was indeed a glorious work.

### Testimony #3

>To deny our natural inclination is not easy at all. Especially when it is related to a good part of our being. When Watchman Nee was younger, he was able to read through 3000 important books written by the early church fathers. And he knew so much about the Bible, so he desired to work out the Bible with rich footnotes just like we have today in the Recovery version. But the Lord did not allow him to do that. what the Lord wanted him to do was to establish and build up many local churches in China. However, he was not that agreeable. You know what happened? He got tuberculosis. During this time, he had a lot of prayer, repentance, confession, almost two years passed he was still lying on the bed dying. 
>
>One day he asked the Lord, why do you allow this to happen? And then the light came, the Lord showed him, in the big China land there are four golden lampstands, that's what God wanted him to do. And then he prayed, from now on, I will give up my natural preference, I will never do just what I want to do, I will only do what you want me to do. Soon after that, he was healed many years later, Brother Lee worked out the Recovery version. The Lord is sovereign. He wants His elect to live Him. That's why He is the life-giving Spirit in us. Why does He indwell us? Because He wants to live out through us and because He lives in us so we can also say for me to live is Christ. This is to live in the realm of resurrection. Don't think this is something very high, unachievable, no. Actually, according to Romans 6:5, through His death and our baptism, we will grow together with Him in the likeness of His resurrection.
