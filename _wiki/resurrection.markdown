## Background

**Resurrection** is to bring the dead back to life, and can only be accomplished through Christ, who is resurrection itself (John 11:25). It is the life pulse and the lifeline of the divine economy. There are many instances of resurrection throughout the Bible, however the reality of resurrection began with [that of Jesus Himself](../christ_resurrection). 

The principle of resurrection is that the natural life is killed for the divine life to rise up in its place (2 Cor. 1:9).

Resurrection is altogether victorious over death; resurrection life overcomes death without being damaged or injured by death (John 11:25; Rev. 1:17-18; 2:8). Death is powerless to do anything with resurrection (Acts 2:24). When the enemy makes a believer think that they are finished, they must remember that within their regenerated spirit is resurrection, and that resurrection will surely defeat the enemy. This is the life which conquers all suffering, and the experience of this life is actually why believers suffer in the first place.

## Experience

In experience, believers first receive the power of Christ's resurrection, and then through this power, they can live a crucified life by taking the death of Christ as the mold of their living. Thus, ihe order is resurrection, death and resurrection (Phil. 3:10-11).
## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

TODO

> I just rememberd the first pet I had, actually the only one. This little animal was in a cage and i found out that he died wnd was just a little boy and the first time i encountered death. This is just a simple illustration, so everything other than Christ Himself death can inflict dmage but not on the resurrection life of Christ. Only one kind of life cannot be hurt by death, and that is resurrection life.
