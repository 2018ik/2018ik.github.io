## Background

Christ's resurrection is the beginning of the new creation. It produced the firstborn Son of god, the many sons of God, and Christ was made the life-giving Spirit.

## Significance

For a vast majority of Christians, resurrection is simply a historical process that Jesus underwent 2000 years ago. Seemingly the most significant aspect of resurrection is that it signifies Christ's complete victory of death, Hades and the grave. 

More prudent Christians may say according to Romans 4:25 He was raised for our justification. The fact that he was resurrected from the dead means that God received the death of the only begotten son on our behalf for the sufficient payment of the penalty of our sin. We have the receipt, the proof that God has accepted the death of Christ as an adequate payment for our sins which should have resulted in our own death.

Resurrection is actually a person. In John 11, the Lord told others that He *is* the resurrection and the life. Any time we face the attack of death in any form, we can contact the Lord as the Spirit in our spirit who is the resurrection and the life.

Resurrection is a present process; to walk in resurrection today is to reign in life (Rom. 6:5). 

In resurrection we all will be like angels, no distinction between males and females. To be brought into the reality of the body of Christ, our whole being must be in resurrection. Resurrection is our destiny; there is a time coming where every particle of our body is in resurrection as the bride of Christ.

The mingling of divinity and humanity was not complete on incarnation; the human flesh of Jesus had nothing to do with divinity. It was in resurrection that humanity was brought into divinity. It is only in death that was can experience resurrection; resurrection is entering into death, passing through death, and emerging from death.

The principle of resurrection is that everything natural must pass through death and then resurrect with God's element. 

## God of Resurrection

The principle of resurrection is that our end is the Lord's beginning. The Lord will "checkmate" us and put us into situations where we have no hope in ourselves, so that will fully turn to God. 

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

In manilla there are textile factories where fabrics are plunged into a bath of dye, thereby losing their original beauty, their formal colo.r It is a sense of what we ma call a devastating experience for those fabrics. but afer being permeated with dye eventually it took on beautiful colors. we may say it was brought out of the vat of dye with splended hues. this is an example of what it means to enjoy the god of resrruection. on one hand we enjoy the living god who performs miraclsi nour lives. For example, a brother may suffer from a very severe illness and the ordm ay heal him from that illness as he prays that he is the true and living god by delivering me from this illness. that is to know god as the living god. but there is a greater lesson for us to learn, and that is to know the lord s the god of resurrection.t he same brother who sfufers from the severe illness but now suffereing from an even ore severe illness, say terminal cacner. the ord my indicate to him not just as the lving god  but the god of resurretion. as he loses all of his hope in himselfa nd medicalscience although he may be treated in a hospital by skillful doctors, his trust is no longer based on himself but on god who raised the dead. he would pray these words recorded in 2 cor 1 oh god deliver me from so great a death throuh this experience work yourself into me, constitue your very being into the fiber of m being, id lik eto know you as the god of resurrection, use this opportunity to imarpt gold silver and precious stones into me so that as I am healed I'll beconstitued with the god of resurrection. Well brothers and issters, this is what the apostles experienced in 2 cor chapter 1 ,paul and his apostles weere excessively burdened beyond their power to cope with their sufferings. These types of circumstances causes our dear brothers to base their confidecne not on themselvves but on the god who rasied them from the dead/
