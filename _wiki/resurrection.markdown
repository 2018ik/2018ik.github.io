## Background

Christ's resurrection is the beginning of the new creation. It produced the firstborn Son of god, the many sons of God, and Christ was made the life-giving Spirit.

## Significance

The typical understanding of Christ's resurrection is that:

1. One needs to believe that Jesus was raised from the dead to be saved (Rom. 10:10)
2. It was the magnificent and full victory over death, Hades and the grave (Rev. 1:18)
3. It proves God accepted Christ's death as justification for our sins (Rom. 4:25)

The problem with these three facts is that they have very little to do with the organic significance of Christ's resurrection for the fulfillment of God's eternal economy which is His endeavor to dispense Himself as the Spirit into our being so that He may gain an organism of Himself which is the Body which consummates the New Jerusalem.

Through the death, the shell of the Lord's humanity was broken and the divine life was released, and in resurrection, the divine life:

1. ???
2. Produces the many grains as His reproduction
3. Transfigures from flesh to the life-giving Spirit

### Victory

For a vast majority of Christians, resurrection is simply a historical process that Jesus underwent 2000 years ago. Seemingly the most significant aspect of resurrection is that it signifies Christ's complete victory of death, Hades and the grave. 

### Justification

More prudent Christians may say according to Romans 4:25 He was raised for our justification. The fact that he was resurrected from the dead means that God received the death of the only begotten son on our behalf for the sufficient payment of the penalty of our sin. We have the receipt, the proof that God has accepted the death of Christ as an adequate payment for our sins which should have resulted in our own death.

### Designation

Actually when Jesus was resurrected, He was regenerated (as well as all believers), reborn with the divine life of God.

### Person

Resurrection is actually a person. In John 11, the Lord told others that He *is* the resurrection and the life. Any time we face the attack of death in any form, we can contact the Lord as the Spirit in our spirit who is the resurrection and the life.


### Process

Resurrection is a present process; to walk in resurrection today is to reign in life (Rom. 6:5). 

In resurrection we all will be like angels, no distinction between males and females. To be brought into the reality of the body of Christ, our whole being must be in resurrection. 

### Destiny

Resurrection is our destiny; there is a time coming where every particle of our body is in resurrection as the bride of Christ.

The mingling of divinity and humanity was not complete on incarnation; the human flesh of Jesus had nothing to do with divinity. It was in resurrection that humanity was brought into divinity. It is only in death that was can experience resurrection; resurrection is entering into death, passing through death, and emerging from death.

The principle of resurrection is that everything natural must pass through death and then resurrect with God's element. 

In the New Jerusalem, the Lamb on the throne represents the resurrected firstborn Son of God who has now been glorified and enthroned. The regenerated believers as the bride of Christ are the constituents of the New Jerusalem. The life-giving Spirit is the river of water of life. No resurrection, no Body of Christ, no New Jerusalem, no fulfillment of God's economy.

## God of Resurrection

The principle of resurrection is that our end is the Lord's beginning. The Lord will "checkmate" us and put us into situations where we have no hope in ourselves, so that will fully turn to God. 

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>In Manila, there are textile factories where fabrics are plunged into a bath of dye, thereby losing their original beauty, their former color. It is in a sense what we may call a devastating experience for those fabrics. But after being permeated with dye, eventually, they took on beautiful colors. We may say it was brought out of the vat of dye with splendid hues. This is an example of what it means to enjoy the God of resurrection. On one hand, we enjoy the living God who performs miracles in our lives. For example, a brother may suffer an illness, and the Lord may heal him from that illness as he prays for the true and living God to deliver him from this illness. That is to know God as the living God. But there is a greater lesson for us to learn, and that is to know the Lord as the God of resurrection.

>The same brother who suffered from the illness was now suffering from an even more severe illness, say terminal cancer. Then he must know the Lord as not only the living God, but the God of resurrection. As he loses all of his hope in himself and medical science - although he may be treated in a hospital by skillful doctors - his trust is no longer based on physical things but on God who raised the dead. He would pray these words recorded in 2 Corinthians 1: "Oh God, deliver me from so great a death. Through this experience, work yourself into me, constitute your very being into the fiber of my being. I'd like to know you as the God of resurrection. Use this opportunity to impart gold, silver, and precious stones into me so that as I am healed, I'll be constituted with the God of resurrection."

>Well, brothers and sisters, this is what the apostles experienced in 2 Corinthians chapter 1. Paul and his apostles were excessively burdened beyond their power to cope with their sufferings. These types of circumstances cause our dear brothers to base their confidence not on themselves but on the God who raised them from the dead.
