## Background

**Resurrection** is to bring the dead back to life, and can only be accomplished through Christ, who is resurrection itself (John 11:25). It is the life pulse and the lifeline of the divine economy. There are many instances of resurrection throughout the Bible, however the reality of resurrection began with [that of Jesus Himself](../christ_resurrection). 

The principle of resurrection is that the natural life is killed for the divine life to rise up in its place (2 Cor. 1:9).

Resurrection is altogether victorious over death; resurrection life overcomes death without being damaged or injured by death (John 11:25; Rev. 1:17-18; 2:8). Death is powerless to do anything with resurrection (Acts 2:24). When the enemy makes a believer think that they are finished, they must remember that within their regenerated spirit is resurrection, and that resurrection will surely defeat the enemy. This is the life which conquers all suffering, and the experience of this life is actually why believers suffer in the first place.

## Experience

In experience, believers first receive the power of Christ's resurrection, and then through this power, they can live a crucified life by taking the death of Christ as the mold of their living. Thus, ihe order is resurrection, death and resurrection (Phil. 3:10-11).

### Person

Resurrection is actually a person. In John 11, the Lord told others that He *is* the resurrection and the life. Any time we face the attack of death in any form, we can contact the Lord as the Spirit in our spirit who is the resurrection and the life.


### Process

Resurrection is a present process; to walk in resurrection today is to reign in life (Rom. 6:5). 

In resurrection we all will be like angels, no distinction between males and females. To be brought into the reality of the body of Christ, our whole being must be in resurrection. 

### Destiny

Resurrection is our destiny; there is a time coming where every particle of our body is in resurrection as the bride of Christ.

The mingling of divinity and humanity was not complete on incarnation; the human flesh of Jesus had nothing to do with divinity. It was in resurrection that humanity was brought into divinity. It is only in death that was can experience resurrection; resurrection is entering into death, passing through death, and emerging from death.

The principle of resurrection is that everything natural must pass through death and then resurrect with God's element. 

In the New Jerusalem, the Lamb on the throne represents the resurrected firstborn Son of God who has now been glorified and enthroned. The regenerated believers as the bride of Christ are the constituents of the New Jerusalem. The life-giving Spirit is the river of water of life. No resurrection, no Body of Christ, no New Jerusalem, no fulfillment of God's economy.

## God of Resurrection

The principle of resurrection is that our end is the Lord's beginning. The Lord will "checkmate" us and put us into situations where we have no hope in ourselves, so that will fully turn to God. 

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>In Manila, there are textile factories where fabrics are plunged into a bath of dye, thereby losing their original beauty, their former color. It is in a sense what we may call a devastating experience for those fabrics. But after being permeated with dye, eventually, they took on beautiful colors. We may say it was brought out of the vat of dye with splendid hues. This is an example of what it means to enjoy the God of resurrection. On one hand, we enjoy the living God who performs miracles in our lives. For example, a brother may suffer an illness, and the Lord may heal him from that illness as he prays for the true and living God to deliver him from this illness. That is to know God as the living God. But there is a greater lesson for us to learn, and that is to know the Lord as the God of resurrection.

>The same brother who suffered from the illness was now suffering from an even more severe illness, say terminal cancer. Then he must know the Lord as not only the living God, but the God of resurrection. As he loses all of his hope in himself and medical science - although he may be treated in a hospital by skillful doctors - his trust is no longer based on physical things but on God who raised the dead. He would pray these words recorded in 2 Corinthians 1: "Oh God, deliver me from so great a death. Through this experience, work yourself into me, constitute your very being into the fiber of my being. I'd like to know you as the God of resurrection. Use this opportunity to impart gold, silver, and precious stones into me so that as I am healed, I'll be constituted with the God of resurrection."

>Well, brothers and sisters, this is what the apostles experienced in 2 Corinthians chapter 1. Paul and his apostles were excessively burdened beyond their power to cope with their sufferings. These types of circumstances cause our dear brothers to base their confidence not on themselves but on the God who raised them from the dead.

### Testimony #2

>In 1942, Watchman Nee was excommunicated from the church in Shanghai, and he told others that he felt that his ministry would never resume again. But through the resurrection power he was brought back, and hundreds of churches were revived and raised up.
>
>In the late 1950s and early 1960s there were ambitious coworkers who raised up dissension and rebellion among the churches in Taiwan. Brother Lee was led by the Lord to migrate to the U.S. to carry out the Lord's work, and the coworkers in Taiwan implored Lee to come back to deal with the rebellion. However Brother Lee said not to worry, as if the work he carried out is of men, it should be destroyed and must be destroyed. But if this work is of God, no one can destroy it. Eventually, the churches in Taiwan were brought into resurrection. Death cannot hold the resurrection life. If we hear of certain churches that are passing through a turmoil, we need to pray to bring those churches into resurrection. Bring them into the third day.

>In Christ's resurrection, He became a life-giving Spirit, which is the highest significance of resurrection. Did you realize that becoming a life-giving Spirit is also a work of Christ? We will realize one day that it is a work to become a husband, it is a marvelous work to become a Father, likewise to become a life-giving Spirit was indeed a glorious work.
