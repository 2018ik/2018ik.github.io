## Background

**Amalek** and his descendants the **Amalekites** were a generational enemy of the Israelites in the land of Canaan and signify the flesh. 

## Significance

The flesh will always be a continual hindrance in one's Christian life, as one continues to possess the good land. No ground must be given to the flesh, even to the good things of the flesh such as one's natural ability. Saul's preserving of certain parts of the Amalekites he considered good such as their livestock is a picture of us keeping the good part of the flesh around. As a result, Saul lost his kingship, and we lose the anointing.Any matters of the flesh must be put to death without any compromise (Rom. 8:13).

## History

Saul was told to utterly destroy all the Amalekites (1 Sam. 15:3). However, he only destroyed that which was bad, but kept the good things such as the animals (15:8-9). Saul believed that he was doing something good for Jehovah and for his people by only destroying that which he considered bad, but this was actually rebellion against God (1 Sam. 15:23).
