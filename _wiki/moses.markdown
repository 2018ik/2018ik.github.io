## Background

## History

After Pharaoh's daughter found moses, she gave him back to his mother for a period of time. During this time, she no doubt provided a Hebrew education and engrained in him the things of God, as he chose God over Egypt (Heb. 11:24-26). Then, he was returned to Pharaoh's daughter to be her son. This shows that in raising up children, they will inevitably be sent to the world to gain a worldly education and upbringing. 

The first 40 years of Moses' life can be characterized by "I can." The last 40 years can be characterized with "I cannot, but God can."

### Birth

After his birth, he was cared for by his mother, where no doubt Godly thoughts were infused into his being.

### Worldly Education

Moses refused to be called Pharaoh's daughter (Exo. ??:??)
