## Background

God always has a move, which is carried out when His secrets are revealed to His chosen people (Amos 3:7). This move is the execution of His eternal economy.

## Steps

First, one needs to apprehend the facts of the Bible and convert them into revelations. Then, revelations must be converted to visions, and these visions will control and motivate the receivers to move for God's economy. This process can be seen in the disciples of Jesus as depicted in the four Gospels and Acts.

The disciples first saw the facts of what Jesus did and taught (John 14:7-11). Then, they received revelation by the Spirit of reality (John 14:20) after the resurrection of Christ. This revelation became a vision through training (Acts 1:3) to disciple all the nations and to declare His name to all the entire inhabited earth (Matt. 28:19). Then, the move was carried out when the Holy Spirit fell upon them (Acts 2:1-4).
