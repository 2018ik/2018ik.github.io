## Background

God always has a move, which is carried out when His secrets are revealed to His chosen people (Amos 3:7). This move is the execution of His eternal economy.

## Steps

First, one needs to apprehend the facts of the Bible and convert them into revelations. Then, revelations must be converted to visions, and these visions will control and motivate the receivers to move for God's economy.
