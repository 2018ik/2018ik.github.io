## Background

**Life** in the Bible most significantly refers to the divine life (Greek: *zoe*), though there is also the biological life (Greek: *bios*) and psychological life (Greek: *psuche*). The entire Bible is a book of life; to understand God, one must understand and appreciate the matter of life. 

## Divine Life

The **divine life** is the uncreated life of God. The reality of this life is a person: the Triune God embodied in Christ and realized as the Spirit dispensing Himself into the believers as their enjoyment. The following verses show that Christ Himself is life:

>He who **has the Son has the life**; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.

\- 1 John 5:12 

>When **Christ our life** is manifested, then you also will be manifested with Him in glory.

\- Col. 3:4

>Jesus said to her, **I am the resurrection and the life**; he who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live;

\- John 11:25 

>Jesus said to him, **I am the way and the reality and the life**; no one comes to the Father except through Me.

\- John 14:6 

>**In Him was life**, and the life was the light of men.

\- John 1:4 

This life is implanted into the spirit as a seed of life, which is Christ. Then, the life spreads to the soul and the body, indeed giving life even to the mortal body (Rom. 8:11). This grants to all things which relate to life and godliness for the building up of the church as the rich surplus of life and the expression of life through the growth and development of life (1 Pet. 1:3-4).
