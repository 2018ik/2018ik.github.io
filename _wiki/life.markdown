## Background

**Life** in the Bible most significantly refers to the divine life (Greek: *zoe*), though there is also the biological life (Greek: *bios*) and psychological life (Greek: *psuche*). The entire Bible is a book of life; to understand God, one must understand and appreciate the matter of life. Many people talk about "spiritual experiences" but very few consider experiencing life. 

The New Testament reveals Christ as "the life" and the Spirit of God is now called the "Spirit of life" and the "life-giving Spirit" (Rom. 8:2; 1 Cor. 15:45). For a person to receive life is therefore to receive the Christ as the Spirit of the Triune God. 

## Significance

A person can say that have had Christian experiences such as repenting. But the difference between the repentance of a worldly person and one of a true Christian is that true repentance touches God. It is not a mere change in direction and a dropping of one's old way of living. It is an experience where we meet God, and something of God Himself is mingled with us, and thus experience the divine life of God.

Paul experienced the resurrection life of Christ in Galatians 2:20. The principle here is not that Paul is dropping his old way of living, but that his life and God's life become one, such that it is no longer *I* (the old man) who lives but the life which *I* (the new man) lives I live in faith.

## Divine Life

The **divine life** is the uncreated life of God. The reality of this life is a person: the Triune God embodied in Christ and realized as the Spirit dispensing Himself into the believers as their enjoyment. The following verses show that Christ Himself is life:

>He who **has the Son has the life**; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.

\- 1 John 5:12 

>When **Christ our life** is manifested, then you also will be manifested with Him in glory.

\- Col. 3:4

>Jesus said to her, **I am the resurrection and the life**; he who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live;

\- John 11:25 

>Jesus said to him, **I am the way and the reality and the life**; no one comes to the Father except through Me.

\- John 14:6 

>**In Him was life**, and the life was the light of men.

\- John 1:4 

This life is implanted into the spirit as a seed of life, which is Christ. Then, the life spreads to the soul and the body, indeed giving life even to the mortal body (Rom. 8:11). This grants to all things which relate to life and godliness for the building up of the church as the rich surplus of life and the expression of life through the growth and development of life (1 Pet. 1:3-4).
