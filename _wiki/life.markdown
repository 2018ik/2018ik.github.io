## Background

**Life** in the Bible most significantly refers to the divine life (Greek: *zoe*), though there is also the biological life (Greek: *bios*) and psychological life (Greek: *psuche*). The entire Bible is a book of life; to understand God, one must understand and appreciate the matter of life. Many people talk about "spiritual experiences" but very few consider experiencing life. 

## Significance

A person can say that have had Christian experiences such as repenting. But the difference between the repentance of a worldly person and one of a true Christian is that true repentance touches God. It is not a mere change in direction and a dropping of one's old way of living. It is an experience where we meet God, and something of God Himself is mingled with us, and thus experience the divine life of God.

Paul experienced the resurrection life of Christ in Galatians 2:20. The principle here is not that Paul is dropping his old way of living, but that his life and God's life become one, such that it is no longer *I* (the old man) who lives but the life which *I* (the new man) lives I live in faith.

## Divine Life

The **divine life** is the uncreated life of God. The reality of this life is a person: the Triune God embodied in Christ and realized as the Spirit dispensing Himself into the believers as their enjoyment. the New Testament reveals Christ as "the life" and the Spirit of God is now called the "Spirit of life" and the "life-giving Spirit" (Rom. 8:2; 1 Cor. 15:45).

The following verses show that Christ Himself is life:

>He who **has the Son has the life**; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.

\- 1 John 5:12 

>When **Christ our life** is manifested, then you also will be manifested with Him in glory.

\- Col. 3:4

>Jesus said to her, **I am the resurrection and the life**; he who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live;

\- John 11:25 

>Jesus said to him, **I am the way and the reality and the life**; no one comes to the Father except through Me.

\- John 14:6 

>**In Him was life**, and the life was the light of men.

\- John 1:4 

The divine life *is* the Triune God, which is why the New Testament rarely speaks of the life *of* the Lord or *of* God. The only time the New Testament says life of God is Ephesians 4:18, and nowhere does it say "life of Christ." This is because God's intention is not to lead His people to pursue particular attributes or things which Christ has, but Christ Himself. Since Christ *is* life, one needs to have Christ in order to have life (1 John 5:12).
