## Background

The Lord Jesus came as a **physician** for the ill (Matt. 9:9-13). If we are in the Lord as the light, we will see that we are ill in many parts of our being and that we need the Lord to heal us. If the Lord had visited us solely as a judge, we would have been been condemned and rejected from His heavenly kingdom. 

## Significance

There are all kinds of doctors in a hospital. The best doctor is one that loves you. Some doctors just want to get patients in and out and you can't even tell what their signature is. We don't want to express the Lord to people as a judge who will punish them, but as a physician that can heal, receive, enliven and save them.
