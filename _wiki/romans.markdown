## Background

The book of Romans shows us His person and work. It can be divided into eight sections: introduction, condemnation, justification, sanctification, glorification, selection, transformation and conclusion.

## Overview

### Introduction

The introduction (Rom. 1:1-17) reveals the theme of the book of Romans, which is the gospel of God. 

### Condemnation

The next section (Rom. 1:18-3:20) deals with condemnation on four groups. The first is mankind in a general sense (Rom. 1:18-32), next are the self-righteous (Rom. 2:1-16), then the religious i.e. the Jews (Rom. 2:17-3:8) and lastly the world totally (Rom. 3:9-20). This unveils the need of God's salvation.

### Justification

The next section (Rom. 3:21-5:11) reveals the accomplish of God's salvation. As a part of justification, there are three items - propitiation, redemption and reconciliation.

### Sanctification

Next is sanctification (Rom. 5:12-8:13), or more specifically, dispositional sanctification.

### Glorification

Romans 8:14-39 speaks of glorification, which is the purpose of God's salvation.

### Selection

The next section (Rom. 9:1-11:36) is on God's eternal selection. This refers to His wise arrangement of the people who were chosen to accomplish His purpose.

### Transformation

The penultimate section is on the life-practice in salvation (Rom. 12:1-15:13). We see that sanctification issues in transformation, and that this is a life-practice.

### Conclusion

The final section (Rom. 15:14-16:27) shows the expression of God's organic salvation, which are the churches.
