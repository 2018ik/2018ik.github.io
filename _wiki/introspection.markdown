## Background

**Introspection** is to use the mind to analyze oneself, whether it is of certain sins or a lack of spiritual attainment. By doing this, the enjoyment of Christ is lost. Rather, the real need is to look away unto Jesus (Heb. 12:2). Anything bothersome which is realized through introspection should be brought to Christ, who is the wonderful counselor.
