## Background

The **ascension of Christ** is His inauguration into His heavenly office signified by the throne to execute God's administration over the earth and carry out God's New Testament economy (Acts 2:36). This marks the end of His earthly ministry and the start of His heavenly ministry. In His ascension, Christ entered into the glory of God, leading His many sons to glory. 

## History

In Luke, after the Lord ascended and left them, the disciples were rejoicing. In Acts 1, the same account is made except this time two men in white clothing (angels) told them that this Jesus who had been taken up into heaven will come in the same way that you beheld him going into heaven.

## Significance

Christ ascending to the heavens to sit on the throne paves the way for all believers to do the same (Rev. 3:21). We can now be one with Christ in His resurrection and ascension, having life, resurrection power and divine authority as a result (Eph. 2:6).
