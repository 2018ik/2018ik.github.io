## Background

The gospel of God involves a person with two natures: divinity and humanity. The reason why He became the son of God in humanity is to go through a process to elevate his humanity and become the prototype so that we can go through the same process of designation and transformation.

## Biblical Basis

### Romans 1:3-4

The entire gospel of God is revealed in these two verses. The gospel is related to a *person*, that is His son, who was the seed of David according to the flesh.

1 Peter 1:2-3 reveals the operation of the Triune God to bring salvation to us. We can see this in the picture of the New Jerusalem; that city has 3 gates on each side. That means He is available to anyone - no matter what direction we may be from, there are these gates we can come to. The marvelous thing is that because we are fallen, there is no standard before we were saved. There is just God's mercy, and the very triune God becomes our entrance into this divine entity, the mingling of God and man. It also says in Revelation that the gates are never closed. Our gates should never be closed, and we are trained to be the gates where mankind can come into this eternal entity.

Everything outside there is no blessing, without surely there is the lake of fire and no one wants to be there. So here is 1 Peter 1:2-3: it touches the very Triune God Himself. And of course you also see this in Ephesians chapter 2.

We also see this in Luke 15. The Son shepherding, to find the lost one. The woman sweeping to find the lost coin, which is the sweeping Spirit. And then we have the receiving Father full of compassion. Man is not only sinful, but became dead and lost. 

Salvation does not start with us, it started with the Trine God, who predestinated us. Before sin, before anything happened, you and I were chosen. Why did he choose us in particular? He just chose us. I myself feel that if He hadn't chose me, I myself would never have been saved. God had marked us out, and only because we have this mark, were we saved, do we live, do we breathe. If we appreciate this salvation, we will automatically preach. If we are not excited that we are sons of God, how will we inspire others?

Romans 10:20 - if you are looking for seekers, you will never find them. How can you have a seeking heart without being saved? God was found by those who did not seek; He became manifest to those who did not ask. Those who are not seeking and did not ask for the Lord are most qualified to be saved.

The Spirit sweeps, and the Son will continue to seek out the lost ones *until* they are saved. This does not specify an end time; don't give up on those who whom you are burdened for. We may give up but the Triune God never gives up. 

### Philippians

The book of Philippians reveals that the matter of the gospel, and living, enjoying and magnifying Christ are inseparable. The furthering of the gospel is actually through living, enjoying and magnifying Christ.

## Principles

### Little Speakings

Little speakings mean a lot. the gospel does not mean most of th time you give a long message, it means little speakings. The Lord presented himself as the sower who sows the seed of life into humanity. Just little sowings, little waterings, and little speakings mean a lot over a long period of time.

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>There was a brother who was raised Buddhist, and he was fishing at the shore, and fell in the ocean and was carried away by the current. He knew he was going to drown and didn't want the others to try and save him and end up in the same fate. Thus, he motioned to the others that he would be alright and to go back. 
>
>In this moment, he cried out to God - "Help me." And he says he heard something, a voice which said: "If you want to swim in the ocean all day, I'll be with you." And he got empowered. And he realized that it was Jesus. The strangest case of being saved and baptized at the same time. This one was chosen. How are you going to explain that? He swam back, he reached the shore before the others. They crawled to shore he walked to shore.
>
>Then he tried to be a baptist for 8 years, and was so dead after he got saved he was so angry he tried to find God in being a baptist. He tried to find God in denominations and couldn't find it. But he came to the church. How do you explain this? He doesn't know God, why didn't he call out to Buddha, he was trained to be a Buddhist? When you are about to die you learn who God is. It's like Paul - "who are you Lord?" 

### Testimony #2

> I had always heard and seen various messages, sermons, and meetings but I wasn't even a believer. Eventually I ended up sitting with my friend in his car, and we prayed and received the Lord - we prayed that we really wanted to receive and to know the Lord. And we did, there was no thunder or lightning, but for the first time in my life a peace began to develop within us. We knew that we finally had the confidence that we have received Christ as our savior.
>
> This was the beginning, then in high school, I was a captain of the football team, and my coach came over to me and said "I've watched you for several years in high school, something happened to you lately?" And he was just talking to me in that kind of way, I said "Coach, I'm not trying to be a better person, but I have received Jesus Christ as my savior."
>
> And he looked at me witha very funny look, got up, and walked away. That was my first experience of speaking the gospel to somebody. On one hand, I felt good that something came out of me on the toher ahdn I felt bad that he walked away and had a funny look. Anyway, then it came time eventually for the first time. As the captain before the game I was on one knee, they were all around me and the coach was giving the last minute word to go out and beat their brains out. At the very end, kind of hesitatingly, he looke ddown on me, and said would you like to lead the team in a word in prayer. 
>
> I nearly passed out, I could not believe he asked for this. Well coaches, when they want to win they need help. So I said OK, I'll pray. I looked around, these were all my buddies for years, and I was praying out loud in front of them. I was nervous and didn't know what to do, and I just made up a prayer. I said, Lord, help us to play a hard game, Lord, keep us from any injuries, and a couple other sentences straight from my mind because I was a nervous wreck. But at the end, my spirit began to rise and at the end I didn't know how to conclude and I said, Lord, you gotta save te whole team the way you saved me. I tell you the truth, that was like god being dsitribute to allm y friends and that tasted so good. I was very energized to play. 
>
> And then at te half time, i didn't think anything more of it I just let it go and this very good friend of mine grabs me by the back of the pants and says "hey, how about we pray again, there's just something about prayer." He had an atheistic family, and I said "how yall guys feel" to the others. And again I did the same thing, still nervous still not sure but the same thing happened, my spirit welled up just for their knowing the Lord an dthat was a refreshment to me. And at the end of the game we won, and usually when we win we don'  need God anymore. But back home in the locker room undressing, this one he later played for the los angeles rams, he says, Hey let's pray, and thank the Lord for the victory. At this point I remember looking to my left, one ofthe coaches a catholic he was kneeling down. And we all got down on our knees and I thanked the lord for the victory, but eventually I prayed for all of them to know the Lord. That was an ecouragring taste to me. I didn't arange it, I felt god arrange it to get christ out of me and to taste the distribution of this dear one. Andt hen alter this year because we've gotten scholarships and things because we've had an undefeated season, myself and this other one was in the dorm of a university, and I had a burden for him. We got down on our knees and prayed to receive the Lord. And then we spoke to his sister, very beautiful, popular, and when we spoke to her, she got mad. She was not happy at all. About 10 years later, through my sister's contact with her totally in another state after we had come into the recovery, this person had been saved and she wanted to let me know. So don't owrry if people get mad at you, it ma be the first sign that they are getting convicted and struggling. 
>
> Anyway, my coach, the teammates and this one person bucky and then my sisters, my three younger sisters are all in the recvery, and they just followed me. There was no tremendous preaching, they just followed me. They didn't have th terminology but they began to recieve the distirbuting and all very precious members of the body of christ.
>
> Then I moved on to college at the universiity of pittsburgh to play football. Th point was I got to know people mainly in that domain and realm, and again it was a big help to me when i tasted the distriubting of christ, the experience and enjoyment of christ in various ways. One thing was to see people, one of my teammates was named mike dick, the coach of a professional team, and I still remember his actually receiving the lord at the university. 
>
> In college I saw that happen, and was able to be in little ways involved in dispensing the lord into other players. And again, not that much dynamically happened, but the point is, we live a life. We live a long term life of receiving, enjoying and dispensing the lord. The lord will eventually reap what he wants to reap. But now through these I was in these bible studies which were called fellowship of christian athletes so you had t obe an athlete to be included. But iremebmer one time one of these athletes happened to bein the wrong sidde of pittsburgh and he had picked up some kind of little skinny guy who was a converted alcoholic and brought him to the bible study. At one point somebody asked him to give his testimony. And after that, I got very clear about another principle, because in this kind of thing, you had all athletes and one of the things is we always invited speakers in and they were always famous athletes. But this little guy i dont know if he ever played anything, this guy i dont remember what he said but i rembmer his shining, his livingness, and I got clear, God is not a respsecter of persons, and He loves all ones, even the little ones who are critical to the Lords increase.

> Don't recognize people just by outward status, but take care of Gods dispensing, god's flowing. 
>
> Then i had an injury and was working out of school and whatnot. At te same time i was involved with a small group of christians who were very sincere. Through this time, we had a burden to go out to people. At this point in time i began to taste Christ in the word "go." After he resurrected the first thing he said was "go." Go means any time. go also means literally go. We were paired up and my partner turned out to be I was about 19 then and this partner of mine was 77. His name was doc fleming, a chiropracter but he got saved at the age 70, and he was reading the Normal Christian Life when I met him, and I didn't understand what he was talking about. But we became partners and learning how to go. So he and I began to practice knocking on doors. And this was avery good experience for us, learnig what to say ,being faced with the same story (e.g. i'm a catholic). So we begant elling them that we're catholics - I mean, we technically are, catholic means universal. We aren't roman catholics, just catholics.
>
> Then we heard about a man who threatened to kill any christian who came to this door. Many were praying for him and fasting. Sometimes we have such a heavy burden that was have to. And it came time finally for us to go to his home, it was a sunday afternoon, and when we knocked on the door, his wife opened the door with a broom, and I said, maam we are chirstians we love the lord and we are here to visit your husband is he home. And she said we work 6 days a week and we are busy and this is the only day to clean the house. I was about to back off, and doc didn't take it and he had very thick glasses in a piercing way and said maam are you sure you're not alibiiasdfjiaasdf, then she paused, and said well come in then. 
>
> Then he walked in from the other room and we began to testify to him. Eventually we atlked and I noticed that there was aTV on and there was a football game. And anytime there was any convicting at all, he looked at that thing and everything was lost. At one point when doc was sharing I saw his eyes go to the TV and I bowed my head and said, lord what are you gonna do about that tv. And right then, the TV just got lines on it, and made a huge noise, and the wife from the other end of the house came in and turned it off.
>
> Within not too long a period of time after that, he prayed with us a received the lord. We tasted the distributing, and doc was so happy driving his 55 chevy back, because we touched the joy of the Lord: christ coming into us through us and out of us.
>
> Don't expect anybody to receive chirst without our prayer
>
> The Lord cannot move unless we cooperate with Him.  Prayer was involved, fasting was involved, and to go. That doesn't mean every time we go there's outward success. More times there's not. But we have somebody else that would never give up, because even when he came to the earth did he have outward success? But thousands rejected and even crucified.
