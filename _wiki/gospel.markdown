>"God desires that all men be saved."

## Background

## Biblical Basis

1 Peter 1:2-3 reveals the operation of the Triune God to bring salvation to us. We can see this in the picture of the New Jerusalem; that city has 3 gates on each side. That means He is available to anyone - no matter what direction we may be from, there are these gates we can come to. The marvelous thing is that because we are fallen, there is no standard before we were saved. There is just God's mercy, and the very triune God becomes our entrance into this divine entity, the mingling of God and man. It also says in Revelation that the gates are never closed. Our gates should never be closed, and we are trained to be the gates where mankind can come into this eternal entity.

Everything outside there is no blessing, without surely there is the lake of fire and no one wants to be there. So here is 1 Peter 1:2-3: it touches the very Triune God Himself. And of course you also see this in Ephesians chapter 2.

We also see this in Luke 15. The Son shepherding, to find the lost one. The woman sweeping to find the lost coin, which is the sweeping Spirit. And then we have the receiving Father full of compassion. Man is not only sinful, but became dead and lost. 

Salvation does not start with us, it started with the Trine God, who predestinated us. Before sin, before anything happened, you and I were chosen. Why did he choose us in particular? He just chose us. I myself feel that if He hadn't chose me, I myself would never have been saved. God had marked us out, and only because we have this mark, were we saved, do we live, do we breathe. If we appreciate this salvation, we will automatically preach. If we are not excited that we are sons of God, how will we inspire others?

Romans 10:20 - if you are looking for seekers, you will never find them. How can you have a seeking heart without being saved? God was found by those who did not seek; He became manifest to those who did not ask. Those who are not seeking and did not ask for the Lord are most qualified to be saved.

The Spirit sweeps, and the Son will continue to seek out the lost ones *until* they are saved. This does not specify an end time; don't give up on those who whom you are burdened for.
