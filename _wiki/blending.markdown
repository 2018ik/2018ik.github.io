## Background

**Blending** means to be adjusted, harmonized, tempered and mingled, resulting in the losing of distinctions. God blends each member of the Body of Christ that they would be the same in life and nature (1 Cor. 12:24). Blending means that each member always stops to fellowship with others. 

## Requirements

Blending depends on prayer.
