## Background

**Blending** means to be adjusted, harmonized, tempered and mingled, resulting in the losing of distinctions. God blends each member of the Body of Christ that they would be the same in life and nature (1 Cor. 12:24). Blending means that each member always stops to fellowship with others. Outwardly, blending requires praying together.

The practical way to blend is to meet together through the cross and by the Spirit to eliminate the natural things which don't belong in the Body and to bring in the essence of the Body that is the Spirit.
