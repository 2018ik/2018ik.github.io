## Background

**Church meetings** are a type of meeting i.e. gathering of believers with the characteristic of mutuality. 

## Characteristics

Proper church meetings should actually be exposing. The Lord's Spirit speaks to the churches, and inwardly reproves, adjust and balances His people. Each person is cared for, but their natural stubbornness, preferences and concepts must be terminated for the oneness of the Body.
