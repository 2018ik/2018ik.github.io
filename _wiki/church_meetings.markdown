## Background

**Church meetings** are a gathering of believers with the characteristic of mutuality. 

If there is only a single meeting each week in the church meeting hall based on a definite, regular schedule, it will be difficult for each member to come into function. The Lord actually wants to build the church through organic gatherings in each believer's home, that the children, relatives, neighbors, and new ones can all be built up.

## Characteristics

Proper church meetings should actually be exposing. The Lord's Spirit speaks to the churches, and inwardly reproves, adjust and balances His people. Each person is cared for, but their natural stubbornness, preferences and concepts must be terminated for the oneness of the Body.
