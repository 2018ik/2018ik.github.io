## Background

**Church meetings** are a gathering of believers so that they may be supplied and perfected. The meetings are the visible part of the church, and can be described as the tip of the iceberg.

If there is only a single meeting each week in the church meeting hall based on a definite, regular schedule, it will be difficult for each member to come into function. The Lord actually wants to build the church through organic gatherings in each believer's home, that the children, relatives, neighbors, and new ones can all be built up.

## Biblical Basis

Attending meetings of the church is God's ordination; according to Hebrews 10:25, we must "not forsake the assembling of ourselves together." Furthermore, believers are often referenced as sheep which flock together (John 10:16; Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 5:2). When believers are together, they are not doing so by their own accord, but according to God. Matthew 18:20 reveals that God is in the midst of where "two or three are gathered." The verb *gather* is used in the passive voice, and the subject which performs the gathering is understood to be the Lord Himself. 

There are many church meetings seen in practice by the early church, such as the Lord's table (Acts 20:7; 1 Cor. 10:21) and prayer meetings (Matt. 18:19-20; Acts 1:14). 

## Characteristics

Proper church meetings should actually be exposing. The Lord's Spirit speaks to the churches, and inwardly reproves, adjust and balances His people. Each person is cared for, but their natural stubbornness, preferences and concepts must be terminated for the oneness of the Body.
