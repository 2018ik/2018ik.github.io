##  Background

There are many church meetings in which believers met at, for the purposes of: (idk)

## Significance

When believers are gathered, the Lord is in their midst (Matt 18:TODO). When the believers pray, the Lord is praying. When the believers speak, the Lord is speaking in their speaking. In the meetings, Jesus the Son of God is doing in each one's doing; all are One in Christ. In a sense, a meeting of 50 technically has 51 in their midst, as the Lord Jesus is ever-present.

## Practice

Attendees must exercise their spirit so as to not exercise their natural speaking. When one speaks in themselves, in the natural life and in the flesh, they do not build up the Body. 

Furthermore, one must see that they are sons of the Father, and that they are in the Father's house and in His presence. The Father is happy when one talks about all that He is, all that He has done, all that He has given us, all that He is intending to do for us, and all that we have inherited of Him.
