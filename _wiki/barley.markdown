## Background

**Barley** in Deuteronomy 8:8 signifies the resurrected Christ . Since barley ripens before any other grain, it is the firstfruits of the harvest, a type of the resurrected and unlimited Christ (1 Cor 15:20). In conjunction with wheat, which is the limited Christ in incarnation, barley is the unlimited Christ in resurrection. The barley loaves which fed the 5000 signify Christ in resurrection as food (Matt. 14:14-21).
