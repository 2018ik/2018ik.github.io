## Background

The **holy anointing oil** (or compound ointment) was a fragrant ointment of four spices and olive oil used to anoint the various items in the tabernacle and the priests (Exo. 30:25-31). The addition of myrrh, cinnamon, calamus and cassia to olive oil is typifies the compound anointing Spirit; the inclusion of the elements of Christ's humanity into the Spirit of God.

The Son who had from eternity been with the Father began a new stage of existence when He became flesh. Prior to this, God possessed divinity, and was perfect and complete. However, He did not possess humanity and was not yet (John 7:39). Passing through human living, death and resurrection, [Christ was glorified](../christ_glorification), adding all the elements of His humanity into the Godhead and became the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of reality, to make Himself real to His believers.

## Olive Oil

Olive oil in the Bible signifies the Spirit of God. As the base of the ointment, the Spirit is the unique God in eternity which contained only the divine element. Now, the Spirit of God is no longer merely oil, but the oil compounded the Christ's humanity. The compounding the spices into the oil was through pressing or cutting, signifying the death of Christ, the procedure by which the Spirit was consummated.

## Spices

The spices were split into three units of 500 shekels (Exo. 30:23-24), signifying the Trinity. The middle unit of cinnamon and calamus is split into 250 shekels each, indicating the second of the Trinity had been split on the cross. 

Five hundred shekels signifies full responsibility. the number five symbolizes responsibility. Five is composed of four plus one, that is, four creatures and one God. Therefore, the number five is God (one) added to man (four) to give us the ability to bear responsibility. 

There being four spices signify humanity in God's creation, as four signifies God's creation. On the other hand, there was only one oil, signifying God Himself. The addition of four into one signifies humanity compounded with divinity. This mingling together can be compared to the mingling of flour and oil in the meal offering. Both of these pictures signify divinity intermixed with humanity. 

### Myrrh

Myrrh which was used when burying the Lord Jesus, typifies Christ's flowing death. This is a sweet smelling and bitter yellow sap-like resin which comes from an aromatic tree with the appearance like tears coming out from the bark. Myrrh contains chemicals that reduce pain and kill bacteria and was used to reduce the suffering of the death (the Lord Jesus was given wine mixed with myrrh). The bacteria-killing power of myrrh is seen in its ability to kill the natural self which is basically a germ and disease.

### Cinnamon

Cinnamon signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ's death. Cinnamon has a distinctive flavor and can be used to stimulate a weak heart. Likewise, when applying the Lord's death, it will stimulate us to make us happy and joyful. 

### Calamus

Calamus signifies Christ's resurrection. Calamus is a reed which grows upward in marshy places, and the root for calamus means standing up. This signifies the rising up of the Lord Jesus from the place of death.
 
### Cassia 

Cassia in ancient times was used as a repellent to drive away insects and snakes, typifying the repelling power of Christs' resurrection. The Lord's resurrection repels all evil "insects" and the old serpent, the Devil.

## Purpose

The compound ointment in in the Old Testament was for sanctifying the tabernacle and priests, things and persons related to the worship of God (Exo. 30:26-30). Furthermore, it says that the anointing oil will be "throughout your generations" indicating that it is eternal (Exo. 30:31) and that it should not be poured on the flesh of man (Exo. 30:32).

Today, the compound Spirit as the reality of this ointment anoints the believers of Christ to sanctify them in their organic salvation. To be anointed with the Spirit is to receive a coat of divine paint. This is a permanent imparting of Christ to man which lasts eternally, and can only be enjoyed by the new creation. The old creation, the flesh, cannot receive the anointing of the compound Spirit.

In Ephesians chapter 1, this can be seen in the Spirit's sealing of the believers (Eph. 1:13; 4:30; 2 Cor. 1:22). To seal is to anoint and saturate with the divine element. Upon being sealed, the sealing Spirit becomes a pledge, guaranteeing God as the inheritance of the believers (Eph. 1:14).

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

>Suppose we paint a chair green with a paint that never dries. Anyone that touches that chair will get paint on them. When we are anointed by the Spirit, we get a holy paint applied to ourselves that never dries. Therefore, all should be affected by us. Christians should be influential in a divine and mystical way; there should be something contagious about us. Sometimes others have said to me, "Don't go to contact that man. If you have contact with him, you will be influenced by him." It is my job as a minister of Christ to influence others. If I am not influential, I am useless as a minister of the Word. A useful minister always has something contagious about Him.
