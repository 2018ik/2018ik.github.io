## Background

Justification is God's action in approving people according to His righteous standard. This is by grace and through the redemption of Christ Jesus (Rom. 3:24). 

Dying for our sins is related to redemption, whereas dying to become our righteousness is related to justification. Redemption is on the negative side, but justification is on the positive side. The cross of Christ is both for redemption and justification. Through His death we have been redeemed from our sins, and through His death we have also obtained righteousness in Him.
