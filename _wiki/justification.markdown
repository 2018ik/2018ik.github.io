## Background

Justification is God's action in approving people according to His righteous standard. This is by grace and through the redemption of Christ Jesus (Rom. 3:24). 

Dying for our sins is related to redemption, whereas dying to become our righteousness is related to justification. Redemption is on the negative side, but justification is on the positive side. The cross of Christ is both for redemption and justification. Through His death we have been redeemed from our sins, and through His death we have also obtained righteousness in Him.

## Justification by Faith

The Bible makes it clear that justification is not out of works: Ephesians 2:8-9 states that the believers are saved by grace through faith, not of themselves, but by the gift of God. Romans 3:20 says that man is justified apart from works of the law, and 28 goes on to explicitly say that man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law. Galatians 2:16 says that out of works of law, no flesh will be justified and 3:11 says that by law no one is justified before God. Titus 3:5 says that salvation is according to God's mercy, not out of works in righteousness. This is in line with Romans 3:10, which says that there is none righteous, and Isaiah 64:6 that says "all our righteousnesses are like a soiled garment."
