## Background

The **gospel work** or simply **work** is a general term to refer to the Body seeking increase. Physically speaking, this is preaching the gospel and building up churches. But there is no plan, mission board, or human methodology in this process; there is no marketing, administrative skill or promotions. The work is fully by the mingled spirit.

Since the reality of the work is the Body of Christ, carrying out the work in oneness requires seeing that there is only one work, the work of the Body.

The work which counts is that which comes out of Christ. No matter what works one carries out, even if it is respected by all men and Christians, is wood, grass and stubble in the eyes of God if it was motivated by his natural self.

## Relationship to the church

The work directly produces the church, which indirectly produces the work (through the ministry).
