## Background

**Faith** is defined in Hebrews as the substantiation of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. (Heb. 11:1). The hoped for and unseen things of God are objectively real, however subjectively to an individual they are "substantiated" (i.e. given substance to, made real) through faith. For example, a person surrounded by radio waves will not be able to detect them and may not believe the radio waves are even there unless the waves are substantiated by a radio receiver. Thus, all spiritual experiences require faith, as without faith to subjectively realize the truths in the Bible it remains as dead letter. Many people who hear the word do not profit from it, as there is no faith in their hearing (Heb. 4:2).

In the New Testament, faith replaces the law as God's principle in dealing with man (Gal. 3:22-25). Righteousness could not be achieved through works of law by anyone in the Old Testament (Rom. 3:20), but through the redemption of Christ, righteousness can be readily achieved through faith (Rom. 3:22, 28). This justification by faith actually retroactively applies to Old Testament believers (Rom. 4:3) through the eternal Spirit (Heb. 9:14). Faith comes out of hearing, and hearing through the word of God. Without faith, it is impossible to be well pleasing to Him (Rom. 10:14). Faith must be kept with a good conscience; failing to take care of the conscience by confessing will weaken one's faith (1 Tim. 1:19).

For example, if we go into a jewelry store, the salesman can only sell something to you if he makes you appreciate its beauty. The salesman is able to infuse into you some level of appreciation of the jewelry by talking about its beauty, its preciousness. This is to have faith in the jewelry. Having faith spontaneously results in a sense of appreciation.

There are two types of faith in the New Testament: objective and subjective. The former refers to the things which Christians believe in, and the latter refers to the action of believing. The subjective faith is actually the processed Triune God infused into one's being. This infusion takes place under the hearing of the word of God. 

| Objective Faith | Subjective Faith |
| --- | --- |
| To have objective faith is to ??? | To have subjective faith is to believe in the Lord |
| Only items related to judicial salvation, that is items related to Christ's person and work |  |
| Objective faith i.e. the facts regarding common salvation is contended for (Jude 3) |  |

| Eph. 4:14; 1 Tim. 3:9; 4:1; 6:12; 2 Tim. 4:7; Jude 3; **1 Thes. 3:2,5,6,10**; |  |

\*Bolded verses refer to both objective and subjective faith

## Application

Humans have a natural concept to believe, but that is not the true faith. This true faith is the faith of Jesus Christ (Rom. 3:22, Gal. 2:16), and is in the mingled spirit (1 Cor. 4:13). One should really thank God for His faithfulness, since they themselves do not have faith. 

In our natural life, we actually cannot believe in God. We need Christ to become our faith. This is altogether based on the mercy of God.

After we are given faith, this faith must be exercised, that the virtue of the divine life may be developed and reach maturity.

## Biblical Examples

### Abraham

The way God dealt with Abraham was by faith. Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness. The law in fact came after Abraham. The God of glory appeared to Abraham, and through this appearing, there was an infusing of God into Abraham. 

He didn't respond right away, but eventually, Abraham's father died which caused him to cross the river. But each appearing of God to Abraham infused more of God into him, to produce within him faith. Abraham then responded, and went out in faith, not knowing where he was going.

Faith brings us into the blessing promised to Abraham (Gal 3:9, 14). It was promised to Abraham that all the nations of the Earth would be blessed. Christ as the seed of Abraham is now in resurrection, and is the Spirit as the all-inclusive blessing. The good land that was promised to Israel is actually included in this Spirit. By receiving the Spirit, we receive all of these blessings.

### Trespass Offering

The trespass offering which was offered by the children of Israel for specific sins. This act of offering was a matter of faith; it is not that outward act that inherently makes them righteous, but faith that the offering will be accepted by God as sufficient for forgiveness. This is a type of Christ who is the real trespass offering. In the New Testament, one must exercise faith in Christ as the real trespass offering to be justified by faith and for their sins to be forgiven.

## Receiving

We receive the Spirit into our spirit through faith (Gal. 3:2, 5). After we receive the Spirit, we are no longer under law. Faith replaces law (Gal. 3:23).

By hearing the Word, there is a welling up appreciation. Then we call on Him, then we receive Him. And now, we've accepted Him through this receiving. By receiving God, we are then able to minister to others, and infuse something of the Word into others.

## God is Faithful

TODO: refactor this section

When good things happen to us, it is easy to declare "God is faithful." But what about when bad things happen? Is He still faithful to us? Actually God is not faithful in providing us with material things. He is faithful to take away our idols. He is faithful to lead us into His economy to eat, drink, breathe and to enjoy Him.
