## Background

The book of **Proverbs** contains words of wisdom which teach how to live a proper human life, such as revering God, needing wisdom, honoring one's parents and holding one's marriage in honor. However, Proverbs should be read with the view that Christ Himself is the wisdom of God and the reality of every human virtue.
