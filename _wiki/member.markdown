## Background

A **member** is person who is part of the Body of Christ (Rom. 12:5). 

## Significance

Believers are one Body in Christ, and individually members *one of another*. The Christian life is not an individual life. Actually as one continues to grow in life, they do *not* gain the view that they are superior or more important in any way, they gain the view that they are mere members who cannot live without the Body.
