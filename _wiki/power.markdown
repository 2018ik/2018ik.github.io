## Background

## Significance


## Fourfold Power

Ephesians 1:19-22 reveals God's power in Christ in four aspects: 

1. Resurrection power: this operated in Christ to raise Him and us from the dead and has overcome death and Hades (Rev. 11:17-18).
2. Transcending power: this seated Christ at God's right hand, far above all. This position represents the supreme authority in the universe (Matt. 28:18).
3. Subjecting power: this subjected all things under Christ's feet.
4. Heading-up power: this gave Christ to be Head over all things to the church.

This power is "to the church," indicating a movement and transmission to the church.
