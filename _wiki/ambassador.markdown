## Background

As **ambassadors** of Christ, believers no longer live to themselves but to Christ, even knowing no one according to the flesh but according to the new creation (2 Cor. 5:15-17). Such believers speak forth Christ, and scatter the divine fragrance of Christ.

## Qualifications

1. We do not live by what we are but by the immortal life, which is Christ (2 Cor. 5:4)
2. We are determined to gain the honor of being well pleasing to Christ (2 Cor. 5:9)
3. We are constrained by the love of Christ (2 Cor. 5:14)
4. We know others according to Christ in the spirit (2 Cor. 5:16)
