## Background

The Lord Jesus rode a **colt** into Jerusalem. 

## Significance

The Lord used the colt, and those who went before welcomed and praised the Lord (Mark 11:8-10). The colt, representing us, was not the one receiving the glory and honor but the Lord Jesus. Thus, we should not think of ourselves as anything; we are merely vessels, channels for the Lord.
