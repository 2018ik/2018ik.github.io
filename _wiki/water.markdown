## Background

**Water** throughout the Bible signifies the Triune God, death (of one's natural life), as well as a satanic dwelling place depending on the context.

## Triune God

| Reference | Significance |
| --- | --- |
| Gen. 2:10 | River of water of life along which the tree of life grows |
| Psa. 36:8-9 | The fountain refers to the Father as the source of life, and the river refers to the Spirit as the river of water of life. |
| Exo 17:6 | Water of life as the Spirit flowing into the redeemed people typified by the riven rock |

## Death

In John 3:5, the Lord tells Nicodemus that he must be born of water and of the Spirit. Water signifies the ministry of John the Baptist, one who preached repentance and the burying of one's natural life. To be born anew, one's old life must be terminated, and the new life must be germinated. This corresponds to the two words water and Spirit.
