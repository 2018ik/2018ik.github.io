## Background

The wheat in Deuteronomy 8:8 typifies the incarnated, crucified, and buried Christ (John. 12:24). Christ as wheat is a limited God in a human shell, as seen in incarnation where the infinite God was brought into finite man. He is also a crucified one who was persecuted, willing to die, willing to be buried, and willing to be nothing.

## Significance

The first item mentioned in the description of Canaan in Deuteronomy 8 is wheat. This is because realizing that one is good for nothing but death and burial, and to take Christ as life is the first step to gaining Him.

## Experience 

Christ as wheat is experienced in limiting situations. As God was limited in His incarnation and human living, so are the believers in their daily living. In the midst of frustration, one can experience Christ as wheat by thanking and praising the Lord for arranging such a situation to turn them back to Christ. Only by experiencing the overcoming life of Christ can one be content with every situation (Phil. 4:11-12).
