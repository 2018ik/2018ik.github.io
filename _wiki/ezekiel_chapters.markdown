## Background

## Significance

## 1

The four living creatures coordinated with each other. The four wings touched each other, and they moved in a way that they do not turn. Despite being tied to each other, they could move as fast as lightning. This is a clear picture of the coordination in the church life. 

## 47

Verses 1 to 12 depict a flow of water, signifying life, out of the temple, the house of God. The characteristics of the flow show characteristics of the proper Christian life in the house of God, that is the church life.

| Description | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| The flow is from under the threshold (Ezek. 47:1) | The threshold is the opening for the water to flow. If the church is open and in contact with God, there will be an outflow. |
| The flow is toward the east, and the house faces east (Ezek. 47:1) | The east is the direction of God's glory (Ezek. 43:2). It is the direction in which the sun rises. The garden of Eden was also planted in the east (Gen. 2:8). The church should be facing toward God (Num. 2:3). | 
| The flow then went down the south side of the house (Ezek. 47:1) | The temple faces east, so Ezekiel is presumably facing east as well. Therefore, the south of the temple relative to the viewer is the right side. The right side is the highest place (Heb. 1:3). This flow has to have the preeminence and we must pay attention to it. |
| The flow is beside the altar (Ezek. 47:1) | The altar symbolizes the dealing of the cross and consecration. |
| Four measurements of one thousand cubits (Ezek. 47:2-5) | Measurement is for possessing. Before one buys something, they measure it to ensure it is to their specification. Four measurements indicate that as creatures, we must be measured by the Lord. When the Lord measures us, He is able to examine, test and judge us in order to possess us. The more He measures us, the more flow there is, until eventually there is enough water to swim in and we are carried away by the flowing Triune God. |
