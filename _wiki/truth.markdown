>"Buy truth and do not sell it"

\- Prov. 23:23

## Background

Truth comes first, and experience follows. For example, we must be clear regarding Christ's redemption to properly apply the blood. We enter into a deeper experience of life by means of the truth. Life is actually the content of the truth.

The truth is also required to bring the saints into their organic function. We need to eat the solid food in order to bring others to this stage. 

## Corporate Aspect

>"May be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are"

\- Eph. 3:18

The truth was actually designed be impossible to understand for a single individual. We must apprehend *with all the saints*; this is a corporate matter.
