## Background

The **pomegranate** signifies the fullness of life, the abundance and beauty of life, and the expression of the riches of life (Deut. 8:8; Exo. 28:33-34; S.S. 4:3). In just a single pomegranate, there are hundreds of seeds expressing life to the fullest. The fullness and abundance of life implies growth unto maturity; the Lord does not want to merely impart a little bit of life, but life in abundance. 

## Biblical Examples

### Good Land

Pomegranates are one of the fruits of Canaan seen in Deuteronomy 8. This shows that the all-inclusive Christ is full of life, and when the believers contact and absorb God, they too can become pomegranates, those who are mature in life.

### High Priest Robe

Pomegranates (and golden bells) seen on the bottom part of the high priest's robe in Exodus, which signifies the church (Exo 28:33-34). This means the church should be full of life. 

### Temple Pillars

The two hundred pomegranates surrounding the capitals at the top of te pillars in the temple signify the expression of the riches of life (1 Kings 7:18-20; 2 Chron. 3:15-16; Jer. 52:22-23). Out of every one hundred pomegranates, ninety-six were exposed to the open air, and four were covered. 96 is 12*8, 12 implies fullness, 8 implies the freshness of resurrection. The 4% hidden pomegranates show that the natural life must be concealed.

### Song of Songs

Pomegranates are mentioned six times in Song of Songs, indicating its relation to the progressive of experience of one's loving relationship with Christ. The beauty of the person is expressed by the cheek, and the cheek of the seeker was described to be like a piece of pomegranate behind the veil (S.S. 4:3b). This shows that te beauty of Christ's lover is reserved solely for Christ Himself. The lover is also described as an enclosed garden with shoots as an orchard of pomegranates (S.S. 4:13) indicating once more the rich expression of the mature life, with many fruits to nourish and refresh.

Further on, the two go down to the vineyard to see if the pomegranates are in bloom (S.S. 7:12). This is for one's fruit to be full-grown in Christ. One's work in Christ is just like growing a garden - the growth of life is what matters. Too many Christian workers are too centered on their doing and not on the blooming of life. This work is not exhausting, it is a work in love; it is there that she could give the Lord her love. At this stage, the work and enjoyment of Christ are one. Finally, there is also a mentioning of pomegranate wine (S.S. 8:2). The significance of wine is to cheer, indicating that the life expression results in cheering.
