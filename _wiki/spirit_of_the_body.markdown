## Background

The Spirit of the Body starts with regeneration, and ends with the consummation of the Body of Christ. The scriptural basis is Ephesians 4:4 which reveals that the Body of Christ has one Spirit. This is the Spirit which seals the believers with the divine element, mark and indication of ownership, which pledges God as their inheritance. 

## Two-way Traffic

Then, a two-way traffic occurs between the believers and God. Ephesians 2:18 shows that when someone is in the Spirit, they can access the Father through the Son. Ephesians 3:16-17 reveals that the Father grants the believers strength through the Spirit that Christ can make His home in their hearts. This is typified by Jacob's ladder which connected earth (man) and heaven (God) on which angels ascended and descended (Gen. 28:12). In this manner Christ comes with His riches that the believers would become the full expression of God (Col. 2:9-10).
