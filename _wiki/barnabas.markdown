## Background

**Barnabas** was a coworker of Paul who had a sharp contention during their journey over bringing Mark, his cousin. Paul did not consider it suitable to take Mark, likely due to his young age. As a result, the pair split up and Barnabas took Mark to Cyprus (Acts 15:36-39).

## Significance

Interestingly, the gospel pair did not split up due to any severe doctrinal or spiritual differences, but a seemingly trivial matter. Barnabas for some reason considered favored his cousin over the oneness of the Body of Christ, as indicated by the fact that Barnabas is no longer mentioned in the NT after this event. This shows us that seemingly innocuous opinions can result in division within the church.
