## Background

**Reasoning** is of the mind, and distracts from prayer. The reasoning in 1 Tim 2:8 is a "disputatious reasoning" which kills the prayer life. Satan comes with all sorts of questions which brings us into reasoning which distracts from the spirit and prayer. When some are about to reason and debate regarding a particular matter, they should exercise to pray instead.
