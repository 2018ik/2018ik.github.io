## Background

Loving the Lord is the indispensable requirement for enabling someone to enter into His heart and apprehend all its secrets and to realize and participate in the deep and hidden things God has ordained and prepared. This is not a love of one's natural self, but a divine life which comes from the Spirit of love (Col. 1:8). When one loves the Lord, spontaneously they love the Body of Christ, which includes all the saints.

Between faith, hope and love, the greatest is love (1 Cor. 13:13).

## Significance

Everything comes out of a loving relationship with God. It is not enough to revere God, fear God, worship God; love is the basic requirement to realize and participate in the things which God has ordained (Mark 12:30). Furthermore, without love, the enjoyment and experience of Christ will not last.

## Biblical Basis

When the Lord appeared to Peter at the Sea of Tiberias, the first question He asked Peter was "Do you love me?" (Matt. 21:15). 

## Types of Love TODO

### Human Love

The finite love of one's human virtues is not universal, and is limited. It is difficult if not impossible to truly love those of all cultures, backgrounds and dispositions. This is not to merely tolerate someone's existence, but to love and care for them as one cares for themselves (Matt. 19:19). God operates in each believer's environments to expose their lack of love, to draw them back to the love of God. The reality of love is God's love can be expressed through the human virtue of love, as in Jesus Christ in His human living. 

### Divine Love

To love the Lord with the first love is to give the Lord the preeminence, the first place in all things. He who loves his parents of children above God is not worthy of Him. The highest place should be given to the Lord.

An example of this is the Psalmist in Psalms 73:25 who desires nothing on Earth besides God.

## Practice

### Look

The best way to love the Lord is to continually look at Him. This is to love Him and to contact Him. 

To look away unto Him as per Hebrews 12:2 implies a distance or rift, having been distracted by other things.

### Calling


## Issues

Loving God issues in many things.

### Occupation

When we Love Hod, we are occupied by Him as He enters into our being.

### Response

### Not Jealous

When we love the brothers and sisters, their joy is our joy; we are not jealous of each other.
