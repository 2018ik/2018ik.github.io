## Background

Our loving the Lord is the indispensable requirement for enabling us to enter into His heart and apprehend all its secrets and for our realization of an participation in the deep and hidden things God has ordained and prepared for us.

## First Love

To love the Lord with the first love is to give the Lord the preeminence, the first place in all things. He who loves his parents of children above God is not worthy of Him. The highest place should be given to the Lord.

## Characteristics

### Not Jealous

When we love the brothers and sisters, their joy is our joy; we are not jealous of each other.
