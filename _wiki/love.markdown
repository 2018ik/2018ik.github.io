## Background

**Love** for the Lord is the indispensable requirement for enabling someone to enter into His heart and apprehend all its secrets and to realize and participate in the deep and hidden things God has ordained and prepared (1 Cor. 2:9). This is not a love originating from oneself, but from the divine life which comes from God as the Spirit of love who puts real love into the heart (Col. 1:8; Rom. 5:5; 1 John 3:14). When one loves the Lord, spontaneously they love the Body of Christ, which includes all the saints.

When the Lord appeared to Peter at the Sea of Tiberias, the first question He asked Peter was "Do you love me?" (Matt. 21:15). To perform a work without love amounts to nothing (1 Cor. 13:2-3). Between faith, hope and love, the greatest is love (1 Cor. 13:13). The degradation of the church began with the loss of the first love (Rev. 2:4-5).

## Significance

Everything comes out of a loving relationship with God. It is not enough to revere God, fear God, worship God; love is the basic requirement to realize and participate in the things which God has ordained (Mark 12:30). Furthermore, without love, the enjoyment and experience of Christ will not last.

## Human Love

The finite love of one's human virtues is not universal, and is limited. It is difficult if not impossible to truly love those of all cultures, backgrounds and dispositions. This is not to merely tolerate someone's existence, but to love and care for them as one cares for themselves (Matt. 19:19). God operates in each believer's environments to expose their lack of love, to draw them back to the love of God. The reality of love is God's love can be expressed through the human virtue of love, as in Jesus Christ in His human living. 

## Divine Love

The divine love does not issue form oneself, but from God who is love. The basis of this love is on God first loving us (1 John 4:19). The Father who is love sent His Son who is grace, the expression of His love. Now as the Spirit He make His love real to us, and we love Him and the things he loves as a result. 

To love the Lord with the first love is to give the Lord the preeminence, the first place in all things. He who loves his parents of children above God is not worthy of Him. The highest place should be given to the Lord.

An example of this is the Psalmist in Psalms 73:25 who desires nothing on Earth besides God.

## Practice

One's love toward God is an active, yet passive love. There must be an active turn to God (S.S. 1:2), yet, God Himself is the originator of genuine, divine love. Following one's turn to God is the passive receiving of His love. 

The best way to love the Lord is to continually look at Him. This is to love Him and to contact Him. 

To look away unto Him as per Hebrews 12:2 implies a distance or rift, having been distracted by other things.

## Result

Loving God issues in many things. 

1. We are occupied by Him as He enters into our being
2. The Spirit searches the depths of God to reveal to us all things (1 Cor. 2:10-11)
3. We are constrained, which means to be forcibly limited and confined within certain bounds (2 Cor. 5:14).
1. We love the Body, including all the brothers and sisters
2. When we love the brothers and sisters, their joy is our joy; we are not jealous of each other.

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

When I was a yong brother I was very zealous for the gospel but several times i was offended by people's response. I really appreciated the brothers woh can speak very well the points very clearly but myself I thought that I should learn how to speak like that. I loved to pursue signs, knowledge. One day I read these three verses which changed my life: "[1] If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal. [2] And if I have [the gift of] prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing (1 Cor. 13:1-2)." I thought that was the highest thing I could achieve - to know all mysteries, all knowledge. That a Christian could achieve, to know all the truths, with faith and power even to remove mountains. What else can you have? What else can you pursue?

"And if I dole out all my possessions to feed [others,] and if I deliver up my body that I may boast, but do not have love, I profit nothing (1 Cor 13:3)." You can change the word *love* with Christ, or to life. In Christianity there are many powerful speakers but if they don't have love or the life of God then it is nothing. This verse truly changed the game. Love is the only way for us to be someone, to do something, we really need to receive the light from the Lord. If we do not have love, we're nothing. But if we have love, nothing is too small. Even to give a person a cup of water, if it's out of love it's not a small thing.


### Testimony #2

One time in the Church in Anaheim we had the Lord's table and after the Lord's table saints can share whatever they like. So one of the brothers stood up, and said "Sitting beside me, this young brother is actually my son who I didn't know existed until a few days ago." And so he said he [the son] named himself Melchizedek since he doesn't know where his father comes from. And as he was sharing this the whole congregation was so quiet. Nobody knew what to say because he said this is his illegitimate son who he didn't know existed. And then he went and described how it happened. I was wondering if I should stop him or not. But after he finished his story, you know what brother Lee did? Brother Lee said welcome Melchizedek! The whole congregation was enlivened because brother Lee said he may have committed something wrong but we still need to love him as the father loved. Don't you think this is something? 

### Testimony #3

I've once heard a brother say something along the lines of, "If you don't love the Lord, you wouldn't want to be one with Him." And I thought, well, there's other reasons why people pursue God right? For example, prosperity, or good karma. Various selfish desires. Similarly, some people marry not out of love, but out of various arrangements, typically because of some material things the spouse has. However, pursuing God for these reasons is not out of a desire to become "one with Him." It's out of a desire for God to become "one with us" and what we are doing. Only by seeing God's preciousness and loving Him are we able to forsake ourselves and live *to* God. This forsaking of ourselves to look toward God is lifelong process of realizing our grafted position in the cultivated olive tree. As we continue to enjoy this organic union, we then see all that the Lord is and what He is accomplished even more, and this becomes even more precious to us, issuing in a greater love and a greater turning.
