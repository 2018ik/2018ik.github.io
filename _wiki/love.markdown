## Background

Our loving the Lord is the indispensable requirement for enabling us to enter into His heart and apprehend all its secrets and for our realization of an participation in the deep and hidden things God has ordained and prepared for us.

It is not enough to revere God, fear God, worship God; love is the basic requirement to realize and participate in the things which God has ordained (Mark 12:30).

## Significance

Everything comes out of our loving relationship with God. Without love, our enjoyment and experience of Christ will not last.

## Biblical Basis

When the Lord appeared to Peter at the Sea of Tiberias, the first question He asked Peter was "do you love me?" (Matt. 21:15). 

## Types of Love

### First Love

To love the Lord with the first love is to give the Lord the preeminence, the first place in all things. He who loves his parents of children above God is not worthy of Him. The highest place should be given to the Lord.

An example of this is the Psalmist in Psalms 73:25 who desires nothing on Earth besides God.

## Practice

### Look

The best way to love the Lord is to continually look at Him. This is to love Him and to contact Him. 

To look away unto Him as per Hebrews 12:2 implies a distance or rift, having been distracted by other things.

### Calling


## Issues

Loving God issues in many things.

### Occupation

When we Love Hod, we are occupied by Him as He enters into our being.

### Response

### Not Jealous

When we love the brothers and sisters, their joy is our joy; we are not jealous of each other.
