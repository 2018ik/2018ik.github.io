## Background

**Loving** the Lord is the indispensable requirement for enabling someone to enter into His heart and apprehend all its secrets and to realize and participate in the deep and hidden things God has ordained and prepared (1 Cor. 2:9). This is not a love originating from one's natural  self, but a divine life which comes from God Himself as the Spirit of love who puts real love into the heart (Col. 1:8; Rom. 5:5). When one loves the Lord, spontaneously they love the Body of Christ, which includes all the saints.

Between faith, hope and love, the greatest is love (1 Cor. 13:13).

## Significance

Everything comes out of a loving relationship with God. It is not enough to revere God, fear God, worship God; love is the basic requirement to realize and participate in the things which God has ordained (Mark 12:30). Furthermore, without love, the enjoyment and experience of Christ will not last.

## Biblical Basis

When the Lord appeared to Peter at the Sea of Tiberias, the first question He asked Peter was "Do you love me?" (Matt. 21:15).  

Love actually constrains the believers (2 Cor. 5:14), which means to be forcibly limited and confined within certain bounds.

The degradation of the church as revealed in letter to the church in Ephesus began with the loss of the first love (Rev. 2:4-5).

## Types of Love

### Human Love

The finite love of one's human virtues is not universal, and is limited. It is difficult if not impossible to truly love those of all cultures, backgrounds and dispositions. This is not to merely tolerate someone's existence, but to love and care for them as one cares for themselves (Matt. 19:19). God operates in each believer's environments to expose their lack of love, to draw them back to the love of God. The reality of love is God's love can be expressed through the human virtue of love, as in Jesus Christ in His human living. 

### Divine Love

To love the Lord with the first love is to give the Lord the preeminence, the first place in all things. He who loves his parents of children above God is not worthy of Him. The highest place should be given to the Lord.

An example of this is the Psalmist in Psalms 73:25 who desires nothing on Earth besides God.

## Practice

One's love toward God is an active, yet passive love. There must be an active turn to God (S.S. 1:2), yet, God Himself is the originator of genuine, divine love. Following one's turn to God is the passive receiving of His love. 

The best way to love the Lord is to continually look at Him. This is to love Him and to contact Him. 

To look away unto Him as per Hebrews 12:2 implies a distance or rift, having been distracted by other things.

## Issues

Loving God issues in many things. When we Love Hod, we are occupied by Him as He enters into our being. When we love the brothers and sisters, their joy is our joy; we are not jealous of each other.

## Testimonies

### Testimony #1

> One time in the Church in Anaheim we had the Lord's table and after the Lord's table saints can share whatever they like. So one of the brothers stood up, and said "Sitting beside me, this young brother is actually my son who I didn't know existed until a few days ago." And so he said he [the son] named himself Melchizedek since he doesn't know where his father comes from. And as he was sharing this the whole congregation was so quiet. Nobody knew what to say because he said this is his illegitimate son who he didn't know existed. And then he went and described how it happened. I was wondering if I should stop him or not. But after he finished his story, you know what brother Lee did? Brother Lee said welcome Melchizedek! The whole congregation was enlivened because brother Lee said he may have committed something wrong but we still need to love him as the father loved. Don't you think this is something?
