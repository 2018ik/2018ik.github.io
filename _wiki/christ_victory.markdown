## Background

**Christ's victory** refers to His complete victory over Satan through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection and ascension.

The Son of God was incarnated (manifested) to destroy the works of the devil, to condemn sin in the flesh, and to destroy sin (1 John 3:8). In His human living, He defeated Satan directly during the temptation in the wilderness (Matt. 4:1-11). On the cross, He destroyed the devil (Heb. 2:14), triumphed over the rulers and authorities in the air(Col. 2:15), and proclaimed this victory to the fallen angels of Noah's time (1 Pet. 3:19).

In His resurrection, Christ has the keys of death and of Hades (Rev. 1:18). In His ascension, He triumphantly led a train of vanquished foes, which are the believers (who were originally foes of God) rescued from Satan's captivity and taken up to God (Eph 4:8; 2 Cor. 2:14).
