## Background

The universe is a **heap of collapse** as a result of rebellion against God. Satan caused the first rebellion, bringing the earth to waste (Gen. 1:2), and Adam caused the second rebellion, the fall of mankind. Within a heap, there is no order, but there are still some who are above others: kings, presidents, generals, industrial leaders. However, they are all within a collapse. It is by God's grace that we are rescued from this collapse. To be rescued is to head up all things in Christ (Eph. 1:10). If aa so-called-church is not headed up, it is part of the universal heap of collapse.
