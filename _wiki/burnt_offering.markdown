## Background

The **burnt offering** was a Levitical offering that was a "satisfying fragrance to Jehovah" (Lev. 1:9). The ram of the burnt offering signifies ChriThis typifies Christ, who lived a life that is absolutely for God's satisfaction (John 5:19, 30; 6:38; 7:18; 8:29; 14:24) and who through death and resurrection enabled His people to have such a living (Eph. 5:2; 2 Cor. 5:14-15; Gal. 2:19-20).
The reality of the burnt offering is Christ, who is altogether for God's will and God's glory.



## Significance

The only life that is pleasing to God is a life that is a repetition of the life Christ lived; this is to experience Christ as the burnt offering.
