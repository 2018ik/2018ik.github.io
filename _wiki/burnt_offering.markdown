## Background

The **burnt offering** was a Levitical offering that was a "satisfying fragrance to Jehovah" (Lev. 1:9). This typifies Christ, who lived a life that is absolutely for God's satisfaction (John 5:19, 30; 6:38; 7:18; 8:29; 14:24) and who through death and resurrection enabled His people to have such a living (Eph. 5:2; 2 Cor. 5:14-15; Gal. 2:19-20). The reality of the burnt offering is Christ, who is altogether for God's will and God's glory

The burnt offering itself can be a bull, sheep, goat, turtledove or pigeon (Lev. 1:5, 10, 14). In the Old Testament, the size of the offering was based on wealth, but in the New Testament reality of Christ, the size of the offering is based on our apprehension of Christ. Although Christ is all-inclusive and is everything in Himself, to a particular believer, He is limited to their knowledge and experience.

## Significance

The only life that is pleasing to God is a life that is a repetition of the life Christ lived; this is to experience Christ as the burnt offering.
