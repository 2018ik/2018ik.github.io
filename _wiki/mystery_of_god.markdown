## Background

The **mystery of God** is Christ, which holds all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge (Col. 2:2-3). This is a mystery that has been hidden throughout the ages, and seen by Paul in Colossians 1:27 as "Christ in you, the hope of glory." The mystery of God that all of mankind seeks to understand is not doctrinal understanding or good works, but Christ Himself to be experienced as life.
