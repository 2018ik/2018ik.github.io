## Background

A foal or donkey is an animal used for transporation and signifies one's laboring in their natural self. 

## Significance

One can bind their donkey to the vine, which signifies Christ (Gen. 49:11), which is to cease from one's own labor and striving to rest in Christ who is the true source of life.
