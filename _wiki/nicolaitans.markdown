## Background

Nicolaitans were those who esteemed themselves higher than common believers (Rev. 2:6). It comes from the Greek word *nikolaos* which is composed of *niko* meaning to conquer and *laos* meaning the common people; thus it means conquering the common people. This was the beginning of the hierarchy established by Catholicism and Protestantism.

## Significance

Today, no one is safe from ambition and the desire to be first.
