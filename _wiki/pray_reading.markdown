>"Your words were found and I ate them"

\- Jer. 15:16

## Background

In pray-reading, we take the Lord's word and repeat it back to Him.

In Ephesians 6:17-18 we receive the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God. Receiving this sword is through prayer and petition, which indicates the importance of praying to receive the word of God, i.e. pray-reading.

## How To

Pray-reading is actually a skill that takes practice. When you really break through and learn how to pray-read well, it is not routine, not dry, and very enjoyable every time. Not necessarily exciting, but it is fresh - not just getting through the verse. 

### Level 1

Repeating the words of the Bible with words of praise (Oh Lord Jesus, Amen, Hallelujah, etc.). We should not be satisfied with this level of pray-reading, there are much more riches to be found.

### Level 2

Exercise our Spirit to breathe the Word as the breath of God by praying with the same words except in short phrases.

### Level 3

Your spirit will be full of feeling, pray according to this feeling and pray with the word to the Lord. In this way we digest the word as food. This will fully mingle the Lord's Word with out spirit.

We don't even need to know the exact context of each verse, and what all the names mean. We simply enjoy, and converse with the Lord.
