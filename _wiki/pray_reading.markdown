>"Your words were found and I ate them,"

\- Jer. 15:16a

## Background

**Pray-reading** is to take the Lord's word and repeat it back to Him, which is to receive the word by means of all prayer (Eph. 6:17-18). Pray-reading is simply a more effective way to eat the Word. For example, you can try to eat soup with a fork, but it's far more effective to use a spoon. Praying over God's word is His ordained way to get His word into our being. The term "pray-reading" originated from Los Angeles around 1966 in the Lord's Recovery, but has been practiced by believers for centuries.

## Biblical Basis

The Word of God is food: it is milk (1 Pet. 2:2-3), it is bread (John 6:35), it is for us to eat (Matt. 4:4; Jer. 15:16). The practical way through which believers can eat the Word of God is not through studying it with the mind - as it is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing (John 6:63). The easiest way to eat the Word with the Spirit is by receiving it by means of prayer, intermixing reading with prayer.

In Ephesians 6:17-18 we receive the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God. Receiving this sword is through prayer and petition, which indicates the importance of praying to receive the word of God, i.e. pray-reading.

## How To

Pray-reading is actually a skill that takes practice. When you really break through and learn how to pray-read well, it is not routine, not dry, and very enjoyable every time. Not necessarily exciting, but it is fresh - not just getting through the verse. 

### Level 1

Repeating the words of the Bible with words of praise (Oh Lord Jesus, Amen, Hallelujah, etc.). We should not be satisfied with this level of pray-reading, there are much more riches to be found.

### Level 2

Exercise our Spirit to breathe the Word as the breath of God by praying with the same words except in short phrases.

### Level 3

Your spirit will be full of feeling, pray according to this feeling and pray with the word to the Lord. In this way we digest the word as food. This will fully mingle the Lord's Word with out spirit.

We don't even need to know the exact context of each verse, and what all the names mean. We simply enjoy, and converse with the Lord.
