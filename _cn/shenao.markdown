**深奥** (shēn'ào) means profound, and is a composite word in Chinese, consisting of two characters:

1. 深 (shēn): This character means "deep." It can refer to physical depth (e.g., deep water), as well as abstract depth, such as deep thinking, profound ideas, or something that is difficult to understand.
2. 奥 (ào): This character means "profound" or "mysterious." It often refers to something that is complex, obscure, or difficult to fully grasp.

When combined as 深奥 (shēn'ào), the word means "profound," "deep," or "abstruse." It describes something that is complex, difficult to understand, or intellectually challenging, often requiring significant thought or study to comprehend fully.
