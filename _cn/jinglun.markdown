## Background

Although **经纶** itself does not translate to the English word "economy" (that would be 经济) in the common sense, 经纶 denotes the management of state affairs by a capable ruler or minister. This is in line with the definition of *οἰκονομία*, the Greek word from which the word ["economy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_(religion)) is is derived.

## Example Usage

为了时期满足时的**经纶**……（弗一10）

Unto the economy of the fullness of the times
