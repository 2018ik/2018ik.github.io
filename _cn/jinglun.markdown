Although **经纶** itself does not translate to the English word "economy" (that would be 经济) in the common sense, 经纶 denotes the management of state affairs by a capable ruler or minister. This is in line with the definition of *οἰκονομία*, the Greek word from which the word ["economy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_(religion)) is is derived.
