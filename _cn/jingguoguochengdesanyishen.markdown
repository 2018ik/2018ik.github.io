## Background

**经过过程的三一神** literally means "the three-one God who has gone through a process" and refers to the processed Triune God.

## Example Usage

**经过过程的三一神**乃是涌流的神。祂的三一是为着涌流。父是爱，乃是源；子是恩，乃是泉；灵是交通，乃是涌流的川。

Translation: The processed Triune God is a flowing God. His Trinity is for flowing. The Father as love is the fountain, the Son as grace is the spring, and the Spirit as the fellowship is the flowing river.
