## Background

**行动** means move, movement, or action and is composed of two characters:

1. 行 (xíng): This character means "to move," "to go," or "to act." It can refer to the physical act of moving or traveling, as well as taking action or carrying out a task.
2. 动 (dòng): This character means "to move" or "motion." It implies movement, whether physical or metaphorical, such as initiating an action or change.

It refers to the act of doing something, taking action, or engaging in an activity. It can also imply behavior or conduct in a broader sense. However within the ministry, it is most commonly used to mean "move" e.g. 住的兴动 (the Lord's move).

## Example Usage
