## Background

**教训** means teaching or lesson involving correction or admonition, and is composed of the two characters:

1. 教 (jiào): This character means "to teach" or "education." It often refers to the act of imparting knowledge, skills, or moral lessons.
2. 训 (xùn): This character means "instruction," "training," or "admonition." It can also refer to advice or a lesson, often in the context of correcting someone's behavior.

## Example Usage

马可福音不像约翰福音那样深奥，也不像马太福音包含那么多的**教训**。

The Gospel of Mark is not as profound as the Gospel of John, and it does not contain as many teachings as are found in the Gospel of Matthew.
