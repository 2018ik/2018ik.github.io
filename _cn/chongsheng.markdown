## Background

**重生** is regeneration, which means to be born again with the life of God. 重 means to repeat and 生 means to be born; therefore the compound 重生 means to be born again. 

## Example Usage

**重生**，就如救赎和称义，是神完全救恩的一面。

Regeneration, like redemption and justification, is an aspect of God's complete salvation.
