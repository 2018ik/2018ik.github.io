The term **职事** (zhí shì) means ministry and is composed of two characters:

1. 职 (zhí) - This character means "duty," "responsibility," "post," or "position." It refers to one's professional role or function, particularly in a formal or official capacity.
2. 事 (shì) - This character means "matter," "affair," "thing," or "service." It often refers to tasks, affairs, or work-related matters.

When combined, 职事 generally refers to a "ministry" or "service" within a formal context, especially in religious, governmental, or organizational settings. It implies a role or duty performed as part of a service to others or to an institution. The term can be associated with responsibilities or functions that are carried out as part of one's official role, often in a context where service to others is a key component.
